that it was a battle being fought against his father; so he twirled his club and threw
it. The club flew through the air, traveling at such speed that the earth shook and
the trees were thrown down. It was by means of the falling trees that the warriors
of Namakaokalani were destroyed until there were none left. This destruction of the
army of <span class="corr" title="Source: Namakokalani" id="xd32e13594">Namakaokalani</span> caused his defeat and Kaluaopalena, the father of Palila, became the ruler of the

his practice while living on Maui, so did he indulge on Oahu. Every time he got a
chance he would secretly kill men and eat them up. When Ahuapau, who was <span class="pageNum" id="pb374">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-24.htm.html#pb374" class="pginternal">374</a>]</span>king of Oahu at this time, saw this, he and his people became afraid of the man. He

have gone and done it.” Palila replied: “I am from the kapued temple; from Alanapo
in Humuula, Kauai. My name is Palila and I am a soldier.” When Olomana heard this
he was sore afraid and begged of Palila that he be saved. Palila, however, refused<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd32e13620">,</span> saying: “You shall not live.” Palila then slapped him cutting away one half, being
