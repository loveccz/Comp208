by him while guiding the king’s canoe. Laamaomao<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-5.htm.html#xd32e4108" id="xd32e4108src">3</a> was the name of the calabash of wind belonging to Pakaa; it was a real calabash [gourd]

Laamaomao. This calabash was given the name of “the wind calabash of Laamaomao” because

king and in time all the powers and privileges that were formerly Pakaa’s were taken
out of his hands and given over to these two men, Hookeleihilo and Hookeleipuna, except
the personal effects of the king; these the king left with Pakaa. Because of this
want of faith in him, Pakaa left the presence of the king and wandered off heavy hearted
and in great grief over the actions of the king, for he did not want to be ordered

Pakaa made his home, and took unto himself a wife, a chiefess, belonging to the land.
In time his wife bore him a boy and he gave the child the name of Kuapakaa.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-5.htm.html#xd32e4123" id="xd32e4123src">4</a> The meaning of the name is this: “the cracked skin,” given because the skin of Keawenuiaumi
