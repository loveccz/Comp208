of which had not been seen before him nor since. He could keep asleep from the first
day of the month to the end of the month; but if a thunder storm occurred he would
then wake up; otherwise he would keep on sleeping for a whole year. If he should be
walking along the road and should become sleepy, he would then sleep without once
getting up, until it thundered, when he would get up and would stay awake for days
and nights at a time, in summer and in winter. So would it be if he was out in the
ocean; if he fell asleep, he would sleep in the sea until it thundered, when he would
wake up. He was without equal in his extraordinary behavior.

<p>Once upon a time Opelemoemoe set out from Kalauao for Puukapolei, where he fell asleep.
He slept for a period of nearly ten days; it perhaps lacked two days, when a couple
of men arrived from Kauai, who were on their way in search of a human sacrifice for
the temple of Lolomauna, at Pokii, Kauai. These men upon seeing Opelemoemoe tried
to wake him up, but in this they were unsuccessful. They then carried him on their
backs to Pokai,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-9.htm.html#xd32e6868" id="xd32e6868src">2</a> at which place their canoes were moored, placed him in the canoe and carried him
off to Kauai. After landing they again carried Opelemoemoe and placed him on the altar
in the temple of Lolomauna, together with a pig, some bananas, some coconuts and some
awa. During all this time Opelemoemoe never once awoke from his sleep. It was noticed
that his body did not decay like the rest of the things that were placed on the altar;
for the bananas, the pig, the fish and the awa all rotted. Opelemoemoe was then left
on the altar until one day it thundered, when he awoke and found himself tied hand
and foot. He then untied himself and got down from the altar.

<p>From the temple he went off until he came to Waimea, where he married and settled
down. One day he asked his wife for a piece of land to farm on; so the wife pointed
out to him certain patches; at sight of the land Opelemoemoe asked that he be given
some larger farm lands so that he could cultivate them. Upon getting the lands from
his wife he began tilling both day and night until the lands were all cleared and
planted.

<p>One day Opelemoemoe felt sleepy, and said to his wife, Kalikookalauae: “I am falling
off to sleep, so don’t attempt to wake me up. If our friends should come don’t disturb
me; if fortune should come do not awaken me; if you should be in danger, don’t arouse
me; and don’t ever complain, but just leave me alone and don’t wake me up, for I have
placed a kapu over it.” Opelemoemoe then fell off to sleep. This sleep was continued
for ten days,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-9.htm.html#xd32e6877" id="xd32e6877src">3</a> and still another ten days. At this extraordinary length of time taken up in his
sleep, Kalikookalauae said to herself: “How strange this is! I had no idea of the
length of time you were going to sleep, but I see you sleep like a dead person.” She
then tried to wake him up; she shook him, poured water in his eyes, made <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-9.htm.html#pb170" class="pginternal">170</a>]</span>some noise and still he slept on. She then called for her brothers, Popoloau and Kawaikoi,
and her servants Poo and Mahamaha, to come in. When they arrived she said: “The chief
is dead; let us wrap him up and carry him off and cast him into the sea.” The brothers
and men then did as they were told, and cast him into the sea. Opelemoemoe slept on
as though he was on land, never once moving. In this sleep the fish came around and
ate his skin.

<p>After some months had lapsed, during which time Opelemoemoe slept on at the bottom
of the sea, a thunder storm came up and Opelemoemoe awoke. When he looked about him,
he saw that he was at the bottom of the sea, all wrapped up and bound with cords.
He then sat up and began to untie himself, and after he was free from the cords he
came to the surface and swam ashore. He had no skin, he was covered with sores and
was unable to walk; so he crawled to a pig pen where he sat down; from this place
he crawled to another house where a priest was living who gave him some medicine and
treated him until he was well. He then went back to his wife and they lived on as
formerly. After the lapse of certain periods of tens of days, his wife conceived a

gave the name of Kalelealuaka. She brought him up until he was big. He was a great
mischief-maker and would often urinate in the calabash of food and such other mischievous
acts. Because of this, his step-father often punished him; when Kalelealuaka would
run off to his mother crying and would demand of her that she tell him of his father.
The mother would then tell him that he had no other father than the one who was living
with them. As this was continued for some time the mother at last told him, saying:
“Yes, you have a different father; he is in Kalauao, Oahu, in the district of Ewa,
in the village of Kahuoi; his name is Opelemoemoe.” Kalikookalauae then handed Kalelealuaka
the spear left by Opelemoemoe as the token by which he was to recognize his son.

<p>Kalelealuaka then left Kauai and set sail, first landing at Pokai, in Waianae, and
from there proceeded overland to Kalauao, Ewa, and then to Kahuoi. When he came to
the house which had been pointed to him as the home of Opelemoemoe, he found that
he had gone out farming, so he continued on to the taro patches where he found Opelemoemoe
planting taro. Kalelealuaka then stood on the edge of the patch and called out: “Say,
your rows of taro are crooked.” Opelemoemoe then began to straighten out the rows,
row after row; but the boy would call out the same thing. Finally Opelemoemoe said:
“How strange this is! Here I have been doing this right along and my rows were never
crooked, but today, they seem to have all gone crooked.” He thereupon quit working
and went to the edge of the patch where Kalelealuaka was standing; when he got to
the edge of the patch he said: “Whose offspring art thou?” “Your own.” “Mine by whom?”
“Yours with Kalikookalauae. I am Kalelealuaka, your son of Kauai.” They thereupon
returned to the house.

to Kahalaoaka to be paved with smooth rocks, even to the forests of Oopuloa in Koolau,
Maui. He also was the one who built the road of shells on Molokai. Lonoapii, a boy

now spoken of as the lizard god Kihawahine); then came Kihapiilani, the youngest,
a boy; there being two boys and two girls.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-9.htm.html#xd32e7034" id="xd32e7034src">1</a> At the time of this narrative Lonoapii was the king of the whole of Maui; and Piikea

fish and brine into the face of Kihapiilani. At this Kihapiilani rose up and went
away from the place, accompanied only by his immediate attendant, until they came

then downwards and at last made a swinging motion. In all these motions the big man
stood in one position and made no attempt to swing his war club. By this Piimaiwaa

<p>After the battle and the conquest of Maui, Umi, being the conqueror, gave the island
over to Kihapiilani, his brother-in-law, and Kihapiilani took possession and became

of Oopuloa was made and paved with smooth rocks. It was also in his reign that the
road on Molokai was made and paved with shells instead of rocks. The name of Kihapiilani

lived in Kaumalumalu in the district of Kona, island of Hawaii. Hiku lived with his
parents in the uplands of Kaumalumalu until he was grown up. He was of very handsome
appearance and was very pleasant to look upon. After he was grown into manhood he
left home one day and started down towards the lowlands with his sugar-cane arrow
called Pua-ne. While he was engaged in the game of arrow-shooting with the boys he
sent his arrow flying in the air and it went buzzing over the head of a bald-headed
man, then over a sore-eyed man and then over a lame man, passing over three ahupuaa<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-9.htm.html#xd32e7142" id="xd32e7142src">1</a> in its flight, until it dropped at the place where a young girl, by the name of Kawelu,
was living. When the arrow struck the ground, Kawelu was sitting outside the house,
so she ordered one of her attendants to bring the arrow to her; after she looked at
it she hid it.

<p>Hiku in his desire to find his arrow arrived at this place and asked of Kawelu if
she had seen his arrow which he thought had fallen somewhere near her. “No,” said
Kawelu. Hiku said: “I saw my arrow drop here.” “We have not seen your arrow,” replied
Kawelu. Hiku then said: “If I call for my arrow by its name it would make answer.”
“Please do so,” continued Kawelu. “Pua-ne, Pua-ne,” called out Hiku. “Yes,” answered
the arrow. “There you are, you two have hidden my arrow.” Kawelu then called out to
Hiku: “Come and get your arrow.” As Hiku reached for the arrow, Kawelu grabbed his
hand and pulled him into the house. As Hiku entered, Kawelu ordered her attendant
out, after which they plighted their vows. This was kept up for five days, when Hiku
became very hungry, for Kawelu went and took her meals by herself without asking Hiku.

me.” “I will not ride with you for you smell bad.” Hiku replied: “I will cover myself
over with my mantle and you can sit on me.” At this Kawelu consented and she jumped
and sat on Hiku, and they began to swing back and forth. While Kawelu was enjoying
herself, Hiku pulled on the vine, so those on the canoe began to haul it up. Just
as they were about to reach the surface Hiku held on to Kawelu very tightly and held
her so until they got into the canoe, and from there on to the house.
