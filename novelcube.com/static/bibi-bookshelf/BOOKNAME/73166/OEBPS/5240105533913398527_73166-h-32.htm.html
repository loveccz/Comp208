<p class="first">Kamehameha was a most famous king for bravery and for his great strength; he was the
foremost of the great chiefs of Hawaii, from the earliest days, therefore his record<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-32.htm.html#xd32e15991" id="xd32e15991src">1</a> must be briefly looked over from the time of his lowliness until he was prosperous.
Keoua (First), the father of Kamehameha, was the younger brother of Kalaiopuu.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-32.htm.html#xd32e15994" id="xd32e15994src">2</a> Another name of Keoua was Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui. The place where Kamehameha
was raised from his childhood up, was at Halawa, in Kohala. Here he became a planter.
He planted the trees which are still growing to this day, which are the <i xml:lang="haw">noni</i>, and other kinds. He also built the temple (heiau) of Hapuu, in Halawa. Thus were
spent his days when he was poor and destitute of land. Of Kamehameha’s person, he
had a large body, which looked to be solidly built, and was very broad on the shoulders.
He was full formed without defects, and there was an abundance of muscles on his neck.

at Kealakaha, in Hamakua. There was a deep ravine, and very narrow at the bottom.

Keoua’s warriors. Forty of them with their spears and javelins jumped on Kamehameha,
but they were as nothing to him. He stretched out his hands, caught the warriors,

battle the slaughter of the people of Maui was so great that the stream and valley

administration of his whole kingdom from Hawaii to Niihau, in which he reigned peacefully
to the day of his death. On the consolidation of these Islands from Hawaii to Niihau

<p>After the death of Kekuaokalani and his wife Manono at Kuamoo, Kalaimoku returned
with the warriors to Kailua. They held a consultation and decided to make war upon
that other insurgent, Kainapau, a commoner, residing at Waipio, in Hamakua. Kalaimoku
and his men then set sail and arrived at Kawaihae. From here they marched up to Waimea,
arriving at a place called Pahupahua, near Mahiki, where the fighting occurred. In
the melee the rebels were annihilated and Kainapau overthrown. He fled to the uttermost
backwoods of Waipio, hiding there, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb482">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-32.htm.html#pb482" class="pginternal">482</a>]</span>while so doing, was found by the searchers. Kainapau was killed on the spot, and his
intestines strung out to dry in the sun. That is the dreadful end of the evil-minded,
the rebellious and the wrong-doer, a horrible death.

was not afraid of the bravery and strength of others. Hema was not trained to be a
warrior, or in the art of war. He was not accustomed to the waging of wars, and was
never a warrior. He was a steward of Kamehameha, and his duties were to take and keep
in charge rations for the king every day. While going abroad in war times he was the
bearer of food, and when a battle was in progress and Kamehameha became hungry, then
Hema would bring him provisions.

<p>When Kamehameha was fighting against Keoua at Koapapaa, in Hamakua, at a place called
Kealakaha, near to Kaula, and in a deep valley called Kekualele, there a fight occurred
between the strongest warriors of Keoua against Kamehameha. At that particular place

<p>After considerable fighting Kamehameha was very much out of breath, and the men of
Keoua were being reinforced. Just then Kamehameha expectantly turned to the rear;
but there were no chiefs, nor warriors behind him, only Hema the steward.
</p>
<p>While Kamehameha was talking to Hema, the enemies were preparing to take Kamehameha’s
life, but Hema fearlessly leapt forward and slew the warriors of Keoua. By this work
of Hema in leaping forward to repulse the enemies, Kamehameha was victorious that
day, and his life was saved, and Keoua defeated. Hence the name Koapapaa until this
day, which means that the warriors became a storehouse of death and the lance and
the spear the pathway, here and there. The warriors were left there in that valley,
a pile of earth.

<p>When Kamehameha witnessed the matchless bravery of Hema, he said: “Today you become
a chief as I am, and today you refrain from carrying and shouldering baggage, and
you shall be a courtier in my presence, and in the presence of the chiefs and the
people also. He who disobeys your word shall die. If the delinquent be a chief he

battles were fought near Paauhau, Keoua falling back to Hilo, while Kamehameha recruited
his losses at Waipio.” On Keoua’s return to Kau from this engagement, by way of Kilauea,
a large portion of his army was destroyed by a volcanic eruption of cinders and sand.
This took place in November, 1790. <a class="fnarrow pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-32.htm.html#xd32e16170src" title="Return to note 22 in text.">↑</a></p>
