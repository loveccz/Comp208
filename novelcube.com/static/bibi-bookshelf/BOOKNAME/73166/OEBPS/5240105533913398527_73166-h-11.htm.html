<p>The people of the place asked him: “Where are you going and where are you from?” He
replied: “I am from Kauai and am on a journey of sight seeing. I am going to Hana
and from there I will make a complete circuit of the island of Maui. After that I
shall return to Kauai.” The people then said: “What a great pity that such a good
looking man<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-11.htm.html#xd32e7817" id="xd32e7817src">3</a> like you should be killed by our ill-tempered king Kalaehina. You had better return
home.” Kapakohana said: “Will he then get angry with a person who goes quietly along
the highway?” “Yes, he will get angry. He is the most violent tempered man and is
also very powerful. He has destroyed most all the chiefs and warriors on the island
and he pays homage to no one. Our king, Kamalalawalu, has escaped for fear of him.”
Kapakohana then questioned them further: “What has he done to show that he is powerful?”
“Here, he can pull up large trees by the roots, and he chops his firewood with his
head when the stewards act slow. On the king’s labor days the people are not allowed<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-11.htm.html#xd32e7820" id="xd32e7820src">4</a> to talk for they all fear him. That’s it that you may know.” Kapakohana then replied:
“He is not so very strong then, seeing that his main strength is only in the pulling
up of trees. With a few blows from my fists he will run away.” The people with whom
he was staying said: “You will not have any chance against him for he is very strong.”
Kapakohana remarked: “I would be pleased to meet him in combat if he will say so.”

held his ground. When he saw the people working and not a word could be heard from

to grapple with Kapakohana. When Kapakohana saw that Kalaehina was about to take hold
of him he called out to the people to stop their work.

<p>Kalaehina then grabbed hold of Kapakohana and held him. Kapakohana also reached out
and held Kalaehina fast, this being Kapakohana’s favorite method [of fighting]. The
two then began to wrestle; first one would be on top and then the other would be on
top. This was kept up until Kapakohana was almost exhausted. While they were wrestling,
Kapakohana was at the same time studying how he could overcome his opponent; at last
he hit upon a plan, and that was to push his opponent to the cliff of Kaihalulu, at
the sea shore, near to Kapueokahi in Hana.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-11.htm.html#xd32e7837" id="xd32e7837src">7</a> When they were directly on the cliff, Kapakohana made one last effort and they both
rolled over the cliff and fell into the sea, both going under. After a while Kapakohana

lower jaw of Kalaehina and showed it to the people who were gathered at the beach.

disturbed by the sound of the voices of the men outside of the house. He then looked
out and saw the people setting their nets; he then studied a plan as to the best means
of getting out. Instead of trying to get out by the doorway he climbed up to the roof
and tore open the top of the house and made his escape by taking hold of a branch
of the kukui tree which grew close to the house. There he sat and listened to the
talk and the orders that were being given by Kapakohana, to make ready and set the
house on fire so as to kill the hairless cannibal. When he heard this, he said to
himself: “I am going to kill you all and eat you up, from the smallest to the largest
of you.” He then jumped down from the tree and crawled up to the men and began killing
and eating them. He kept this up until he came up to Kapakohana. When Kapakohana saw
the cannibal he jumped at him and held him by the throat. The fight was continued
from the rest of that night and all the next day until just as the sun was sinking
in the sea the cannibal was at last made fast and held to the ground. Kapakohana<span id="xd32e7873"/> then reached out for his war club and struck the cannibal in the temple a couple

The people within the house all denied ever calling him. This was of course meant
for an insult and Kapunohu felt it deeply.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-11.htm.html#xd32e7957" id="xd32e7957src">8</a> Kapunohu then went back to his sister and told her of his treatment. Shortly after

<p>After this display of his strength Kapunohu continued on his way up until he met two
old men who were farming along the highway. The land which they were cultivating is
known as Nahuluaina. Kapunohu then said to them: “Say, old men, I want you to each
take a flag and run with all your might away from each other and where you stop, that
shall be the boundary<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-11.htm.html#xd32e7983" id="xd32e7983src">12</a> of your lands.” The names of the old men were Pioholowai and Kukuikiikii. They each
took up a flag and ran with all their might. In their effort to cover as much ground
as possible, Pioholowai did not go very far before he became exhausted and so planted
his flag; because of this his land was short and the name of that land is Pioholowai
to this day, after his name. Kukuikiikii, on the other hand, ran and covered much
more ground before he planted his flag, consequently his land was much larger, and
the name of the land is Kukuikiikii to this day, after the old man who owned it. Because
of the mode of the division of these two lands all the following pieces of lands are
cut off short and do not run clear up to the mountains: Hualoa 1, Hualoa 2, Kealahewa

Kapunohu was a handsome man and his whole body was without blemish. So the girls,
too, were beautiful to look upon.

<p>At sight of the young man, Niulii inquired: “Who is the third person?” The daughters
replied: “A stranger that belongs to us. We were bathing when he came along, and being
late we brought him home for the night and he can resume his journey tomorrow.” Niulii
then said: “You should take him as your husband, you two women,” so Kapunohu took
the two girls as his wives and made his home with the king, Niulii. A few days after

Keolewa by name, had six rounds on it. It was so long that when it was stood up its
point would be wet with the mist in the heaven, and when laid down it would extend
over the whole length of an ahupuaa<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-11.htm.html#xd32e8032" id="xd32e8032src">18</a> from the sea to the mountain; when held up it would hide the sun and it could also

breast of Kapunohu, for the body of Paopele was very large and powerful; but his god
Kanikaa said: “Don’t be afraid of the loud-voiced thunder in the heaven for it has
no strength; you thrust him with your spear, Kanikawi, and I will bite him.” Soon
after this instruction was given by Kanikaa, he bit the back of Paopele. While Paopele
was considering the nature of this thing on his back, Kapunohu threw his spear at
Paopele, which hit him squarely, passed through him and killed him instantly. Lamakee
from that day to this became famous, for it was here that the great warrior Paopele
was killed by Kapunohu. The remnant of the army of Kukuipahu was again routed and
they retreated to Kaluawilinau, at Puuepa, and from there they retreated to Upolu,
then Puakea, then on to Kamilo and up to the place where the old men planted their
flags. Because of this fact the ahupuaa of Kukuipahu is one of the largest in the
district of Kohala to this day. The whole of Kohala thus came under the charge of
Niulii and he was acknowledged the king of the whole district.

the night; from this place he again set sail and landed at Kahalepalaoa in Lanai;
then from this last place he set out and landed at Kaluakoi in Molokai; then from

no food ready. You must be hungry. There is food growing out there in the patches.
Your brother-in-law, Olopana is out with the men, working.” Kapunohu said to the sister:
“Let us go out so that you can show me the patches.” When they came to the place she
pointed out eight patches of large taro and returned home.

<p>Kapunohu then set to work and pulled up all the taro in the eight patches, tied the
taro into bundles and carried the whole lot in his two arms to the house, each arm
holding the taro of four patches. When Kapunohu arrived at the house with the taro
his sister looked on and said: “What an idea! I should think you would pull up but
one patch, but here you have pulled up all the patches.” Kapunohu replied: “This will
give us plenty of food; we will not be required to get it in small quantities.” Kapunohu

the fire lit, he took some of the taro and cut it up and threw the pieces into the
fire and in this way used the taro for firewood. Because of this action of Kapunohu,
the saying, “the hard taro of Waiahole,” is known from Hawaii to Niihau.

<p>When Olopana saw what Kapunohu had done, he began to scheme, that with the use of
Kapunohu he would be able to conquer the whole of Oahu, as he and Kakuhihewa, the
king of the Kona side of Oahu, were on bad terms. Through the advice of his priest,
Olopana was made doubly sure that Kapunohu was a very strong and brave man and was
fearless and willing to meet all comers. Therefore Olopana made Kapunohu the commander-in-chief
of his forces and urged upon him to go and fight Kakuhihewa. In this battle Kakuhihewa
was slain by Kapunohu and the whole of Oahu came under the rule of Olopana.

and skill in the use of the sling; he was without equal in its practice; his left
hand was considered better than his right, and he could throw a stone for a distance
of six miles and in the seventh mile its force ceased. No person in Kauai was found
who could face him, not from amongst the chiefs or soldiers. Because of this man people
were afraid to travel between Koloa and Nawiliwili; those on the Koolau side could
not pass over to Nawiliwili and those from the Kona side were afraid to travel toward

<p>When Kapunohu arrived at Lawai he was entertained that night by some of the people
of the place, and on the next day he prepared to continue on his journey. When he
was ready to start, the people said: “You must not go by this way or you will get
killed by our great warrior.” Kapunohu then asked: “Who is this warrior?” “Kemamo.”
“In what is his strength?” “He is very skilful in the use of the sling. He never misses
a shot, and the strength of his flying stone will go over five miles. Therefore you
must not go for you will get killed.” Kapunohu said: “Then he is not strong. The sling
is only a plaything for the boys of our place and it is not considered of any consequence.”
These remarks made by Kapunohu were carried around until they reached Kemamo; so Kemamo
made the remark: “Yes, this is the first time that my strength in the use of the sling
has been denied. Well and good; if he desires to come and test as which of us is the
stronger, let him come on.” When Kapunohu heard this, he went out to meet Kemamo.
Upon seeing Kapunohu, Kemamo asked: “Are you the man that has said that I have no
strength in the use of the sling?” Kapunohu replied: “Yes, I am the man. It is because
these people said that you are very skilful in the use of the sling, so I said, that
it is the plaything with the small boys at our place.”
