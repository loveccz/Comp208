<p class="first">This was a very brave and fearless young man, and it was this man that broke the kapu
poles, the sacred places of worship, the kapu insignia and all the different sacred
things. Because of these doings of Maikoha, the father, Konikonia, became very angry.
He was not sure which one had done this unholy thing, so he pondered deeply on how
he was to find out the guilty person. After spending several days in study he decided
on a certain course as follows: he procured two long poles and tied one of them on
the back of the necks of all his ten children and the other he tied under the chin.
He thought within himself that the one who would not cry would be the guilty one,
a sure proof he thought, and he must be sent away. In applying this test, Maikoha
was the one who did not cry out, all the other children cried more or less. This satisfied
the father that Maikoha was the guilty one and so he was sent away, to go wherever
he pleased.

<p>After Maikoha had departed from home, his sisters came in search of him and they traveled
as far as Kaupo, where they found he had already changed into the wauke plant. After
they had located him they began to make a search for his navel, looking from the top
of the plant to the bottom, but they were unable to find it; so a search was made
of the roots, and there they found it, for Maikoha had secreted it there. Shortly
after this the sisters left Maikoha in Kaupo, Maui, and they continued on their journey
until they arrived in Oahu.

and after it was covered up they set out to the beach to do some fishing. After fishing
for some time without success Kaneaukai called out to them: “Say, you old men, which
god do you worship and keep?” The old men replied: “We are worshiping a god, but we
do not know his name.” Kaneaukai then said: “You will now hear and know his name.
When you let down your net again, call out, ‘Here is the food and fish, Kaneaukai,’
that is the name of the god.” The old men assented to this, saying: “Yes, this is
the first time that we have learned his name.” Because of this fact, Kaneaukai is
the fish god worshiped by many to this day, for Kaneaukai became their fish god, and
from them others, if they so desired.
