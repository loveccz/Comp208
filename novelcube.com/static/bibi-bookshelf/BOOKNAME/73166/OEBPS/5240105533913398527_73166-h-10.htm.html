girl, a virgin; she was good to look upon and was a favorite with her people. Some
time before, her parents had promised her to Kauhi, a man of note who was at this
time living with Kakuhihewa, the king of Oahu. Kauhi belonged to Koolau and he lived
at a place called Alele.

engagement, he began to collect and to send her all manner of good things. After the
lapse of certain ten-day periods (<i xml:lang="haw">anahulu</i>) he, however, found something against her, and it came about in this way. Some people
who were desirous of seeing Kahalaopuna put to death, while on their way from Manoa
to Koolau, upon meeting Kauhi made up a slanderous story<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-10.htm.html#xd32e7343" id="xd32e7343src">2</a> against her in the following manner: “How strange indeed was the behavior of your
intended wife, Kahalaopuna! She went dancing two nights now, and on each night had
a separate lover.” When Kauhi heard this from these men, he said to himself: “I shall
indeed kill her for she has taken all the good things from my lord which I gave her.
She has now gone and defiled herself.”

Pohakea, a place above Ewa lying close to the Kaala mountain. While on their way,
she meditated within herself as to the probable cause of this journey. In going they
took the upper road where people seldom passed, passing along Pauoa<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-10.htm.html#xd32e7350" id="xd32e7350src">3</a> and Waolani,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-10.htm.html#xd32e7353" id="xd32e7353src">4</a> then along upper Kalihi and so on to Manana,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-10.htm.html#xd32e7356" id="xd32e7356src">5</a> where they spent the night. In all this traveling the hands of Kahalaopuna were bound
with a cord by Kauhi and consequently her skirt (pa-u) became unfastened and trailed
on behind, she being unable to fasten it properly as her hands were bound.

<p>One day near the month of October while Ku and Hina were living in their home, they
were possessed with the desire to go up the Wailuku river for oopu and shrimps. In
this expedition they took all their servants along with them leaving Uweuwelekehau
alone with his attendants. After his parents had departed on their way up the stream
Uweuwelekehau set out for the Kalopulepule river to sail his canoe. As he was in the
river a small cloud appeared from the sea and came on up till it stood directly above
the Wailuku stream when it came down in the form of rain, flooding the whole country
and causing the stream to flow in a rush to the ocean, carrying Uweuwelekehau along
in its flood. This carrying away of Uweuwelekehau by the flood was caused by Kane
and Kanaloa. After he was thus carried out to sea some one went up and informed Ku
of the matter and he and his company returned home and a search was made, but the
boy could not be found. The parents then mourned for the boy.

<p>Early the next morning when Luukia awoke from her sleep she told her attendant, Papioholoholokahakai,
to go down and catch her some fish for breakfast, as there was none ready for her
morning meal. Papioholoholokahakai took up his net and proceeded to the beach. After
three casts of his net he found that he had caught nothing. Thinking that his charge
would get angry with him he again made another attempt, when to his delight he caught
a small stubby fish, and upon closer inspection he saw that it was a good fish. He
then took the fish and placed it into a calabash with some water and proceeded home.
When he arrived in the presence of Luukia, he handed her the calabash which contained
the fish. Luukia looked at the fish and was made glad by the shape of the fish and
took and gave it to her servants with the order that it be given good care.

was the elder and Kalaehina was the younger. They were born and raised in Holualoa,
Kona, during the reign of Keawenuiaumi, king of Hawaii. Regarding Kalaepuni: he was
a very mischievous boy and one who was without fear. At the age of six he was able
to whip all his playmates and his strength developed from that time on until he reached
the age of twenty years, at which time Kalaepuni became famous<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-10.htm.html#xd32e7605" id="xd32e7605src">1</a> over the whole of Hawaii for his great strength. At twenty he determined to kill

fishermen to the fishing grounds outside of Kalahiki; they went out shark fishing.
After some of the bait was thrown out the sharks began to gather under the canoe,

the canoe. While Keawenuiaumi’s men were hauling the sharks up, Kalaepuni jumped out

Kalaepuni saw the people he asked: “Where are the canoes?” Kalaehina replied: “We
hauled them until we could not get them past a certain place by a cliff and we have
left them there all stuck fast.” When Kalaepuni heard this he became very angry at
his younger brother and said to him: “Did I not put you over all the men? Why did
you not make them carry out my orders? You must therefore go and haul them down by

able to get the canoes down you shall be a sacrifice for the temple.”

<p>When Kalaehina heard the command given him by his older brother he was much frightened,
for he believed that he was unable to get the canoes down. He, however, began to study
the matter and all that night and the next day he spent in making plans as to how
to overcome this most difficult matter. After at last hitting on a plan he went up
to the place where the canoes were lying, took a look at them and proceeded to Kau.
When he arrived in Kau he deceived the people, saying: “Ye people of Kau, the king,
Kalaepuni has given me orders to tell you to go and haul the canoes down to the beach.”
When the people heard this they all started for Kapua. Upon arriving at the place,
the people lifted up the canoes, carried them to a place from where they could be
dragged to the beach and placed in the sea; five of them were then paddled to Keauhou,
where Kalaepuni was stopping, while Kalaehina followed behind with the other canoe
on his back, coming by the upper road to Kainaliu. When Kalaepuni saw this he praised
his younger brother for being so strong.

<p>When the day of celebration of Kalaepuni arrived the king displayed his brother’s
strength in the presence of all the people. Kalaehina took up one of the six canoes
and threw it into the sea as though it was a spear, without much effort. A few days
after this Kalaehina saw the king’s chief steward chopping firewood, he picked up
a stick of wood and struck it with his head, breaking the stick into small bits, thus
making the hard ohia appear as nothing.
