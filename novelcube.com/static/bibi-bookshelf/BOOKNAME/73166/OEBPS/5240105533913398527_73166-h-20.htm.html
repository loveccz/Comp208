Kaialeale is still asleep. If he is I can dive down and come up at that point over
yonder where I will get two lobsters, and my mother and I will have something to eat
with our potatoes in the uplands.” While Punia was talking to Kaialeale the rest of
the sharks woke up. Kaialeale then said to the other sharks: “Let us watch and see
where Punia dives, then we will dive in after him.” Punia had a stone in his hand
while he was talking which he threw out beyond the point where he spoke about diving
to get the lobsters. When the stone struck the water the sharks made a dive for the
place leaving the cave of lobsters unguarded. Punia then dove down and secured two
lobsters and then addressed the sharks: “Here there, Punia has gone down and he has
two lobsters, giving him something to live on. This will keep my mother and myself
alive. It was the first shark, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth,
the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, it was the eleventh shark that told
me what to do, the one with the thin tail. He was the one that told me what to do.”
When Kaialeale heard this from Punia, he ordered all the sharks to come together and
get in a row. He then proceeded to count them, and sure <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-20.htm.html#pb296" class="pginternal">296</a>]</span>enough there were ten of them, then he looked for the one with the thin tail. When
he found the one he said: “So it was you that told Punia what to do. You shall die.”
After this shark was killed, Punia called out: “So you have killed one of your own
kind.” After this Punia returned home to his mother.

<p>After they had eaten the two lobsters they were again without any fish, so Punia again
asked his mother: “Let me go down and get us some more lobsters from that cave.” The
mother replied: “Your last trip probably was the one in which you came home safe.
This trip may be your last. Don’t go down.” Punia, however, rose and went down to
the cave of lobsters. When he came to the place, he called out as he did at the first
time. Then when Kaialeale and the other sharks woke up he threw a stone toward the
other side away from the cave. When the stone struck the water the sharks went after
it. Punia then dove down and again got two lobsters. After he got ashore he called
out to the sharks as he did at the other time and then counted out the sharks from
the first to the tenth, and then named the tenth one as the one which told him what
to do. “The one with the large stomach,” said Punia. Kaialeale then proceeded to count
the sharks and when he found the one with the large stomach, he was killed by the
others. Punia then followed out the same line of conversation as used by him at the

<p>Punia thus continued deceiving the sharks until all were killed except Kaialeale.
After this Punia hewed out two sticks each a yard long; he next procured the two necessary

beach and when he got directly over the cave, where Kaialeale was sleeping, he called
out: “If when I dive down Kaialeale should bite me and I die and my blood should come
to the surface, then my mother will see it and I shall come to life again. But if
when I dive, Kaialeale should open wide his mouth so that I am swallowed whole, I
shall die and will never be able to come to life again.” While Punia was talking,
Kaialeale was listening, and he said to himself: “I will not bite you for you might
come to life again. I shall open my mouth wide enough for you to walk in. So this
is the time when I shall kill you. Yes, you shall die; nothing will save you.” Punia
then dove down with his bag, when Kaialeale opened his mouth and Punia walked in.
As soon as Punia got into the mouth it tried to close up, but Punia took the two sticks
he had hewed out and stood them up which kept the mouth open. He then rubbed the two
sticks and when the fire was started he placed on the coals; he next took out his
opihi shell and began to scrape the inside of the shark and after he had a ball of
meat he proceeded to cook it and when cooked he sat down and with his potatoes he
made his meal, while the shark was swimming here and there through the ocean. This
scraping hurt the shark so much that he could not keep still; he was forced to go
here and there. Punia was carried around in the shark for about ten days, when at
last the shark began to grow weak and it made its way back toward <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-20.htm.html#pb298" class="pginternal">298</a>]</span>land, arriving outside of Kona, at a place called Alula, directly out of Hiiakanoholae.
Punia on the other hand became bald, from being in its belly; the work of the rascal.

him: “What are you crying about?” Punia replied: “I am crying because of my father;
this is the place where we used to fish. When I saw the lava rocks, I thought of him.”
The ghosts then said to Punia: “Well and good, you shall show us how and where to
cast the nets and we will work under you.” Punia assented to this saying: “All right,
if you carry out my instructions and do as I tell you we will catch all the fish you
want. This is what I want you to do: Two of you must swim out with me while the rest
shall stay ashore here; and when I call to some of you to swim out to us then come.
When I stick up two fingers, that will mean that I want two to come; and if I stick
up one finger, then I want one to come. That is the way the fish of this place are
caught, because the bottom is all open and there are several places where the nets
must be let down.” The ghosts all heard the instructions of Punia. Punia after this
swam out with two of the ghosts, and after some little time he called out to the two
ghosts to open out the nets and said: “When I give you the order to dive, then you
must dive down and don’t come up again until I pull on the nets, for I see there is
a large school of them here.” When the ghosts dove down Punia dove in after them and
twisted the nets tangling up the ghosts and killing them. After these two were killed
Punia came up to the surface and called out to those ashore holding up two fingers.
Two more came swimming and again they were killed. He next called out and held up
one finger and that one was also killed. Punia continued this deceit until there were
but very few of the ghosts left alive. When the ghosts saw that Punia was the only
one to be seen in the sea they called out to Punia: “Where are the rest of our companions?”
“They are here,” replied Punia. “They are twisting up the kala, the uhu, the nenue,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-20.htm.html#xd32e10732" id="xd32e10732src">9</a> the palani and the transient fish of these waters.” The ghosts that were left then
said one to another: “They are not killed.” Punia then held up one finger, calling
for only one. One came out. Punia called for two and two swam out. Punia continued
to do this until all but one of the ghosts were killed.
