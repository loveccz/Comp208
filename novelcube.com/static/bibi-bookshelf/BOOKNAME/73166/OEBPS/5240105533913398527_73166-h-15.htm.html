them watching the game he asked: “Whose are the white pebbles?” Keaweikekahialii answered:
“The white pebbles are Keliiokaloa’s and the black ones are mine.” At this time there
were but very few black pebbles left on the board, in other words Keaweikekahialii
was about to again lose to Keliiokaloa.

when Mao said to Keaweikekahialii: “Send a man to the uplands and inform the chiefs
that the king, Keliiokaloa, desires one of the chiefs to come on down accompanied
by one servant.” Before Keaweikekahialii sent off the messenger, he ordered that his
own followers be requested to come to the house. After the arrival of his men he gave
them orders to kill the first chief and his servant as soon as they arrived. Upon
the arrival of one of the chiefs and his servant they were both set on and killed.

<p>When Kalapanakuioiomoa saw that all the chiefs were killed he escaped through the
forest and came to and sojourned at Waipio, where he took a wife of that place. In
course of time his wife conceived a child; but taking a canoe he set out, landing
at Kaluaihakoko, Maui. From this place he again sailed and landed at Maunalei, Lanai,
where he settled down and made his residence. After Kalapanakuioiomoa had been in
Lanai for some time, he took unto himself a wife there and lived as a commoner, tilling
the land and going to the uplands for water. He lived without disclosing his rank
or his identity to any one.

you to return to Hawaii and perpetuate the blue blood of the chiefs.” Kalapanakuioiomoa
answered: “I will not return with you because I have made oath that I will live and
die here; therefore you must go back to Hawaii and go to Waipio, where you will find
a chiefess of high blood, my daughter.” The messengers then returned to Hawaii and
to Waipio, where the daughter of Kalapanakuioiomoa was living and took her to the
