<p class="first">Kaluaopalena and Mahinui, the daughter of Hina, were the father and mother of Palila,
who was born in Kamooloa, in Koloa, Kauai; but he was brought up in the temple of
Humuula. Palila at his birth was in the form of a piece of cord<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-7.htm.html#xd32e6254" id="xd32e6254src">1</a> and was therefore thrown away in a pile of rubbish, the parents not knowing that
it was a child, and furthermore they were disappointed upon seeing the cord. When
Palila was born, Hina [the grandmother] was living in the temple of Humuula up in
the mountains; but through her supernatural powers she saw the birth of Palila, so
she came down to Mahinui and Kaluaopalena and asked them: “Where is the child that
was born a short time ago?” Mahinui and Kaluaopalena replied: “There was no child,
it was a piece of cord; it is lying there in that rubbish pile.” Hina went over to
the place and took up the piece of cord from amongst the rubbish and bundled it up
in a piece of white kapa and returned to her home.

<p>After Hina arrived at her home in the temple of Humuula, away up in the mountains
in a very lonely spot, she unwrapped the bundle of Palila and put it into another
piece of white kapa. This was done at three different times, when it began to assume
human form. After the lapse of a full period of ten days, the body of Palila was complete
in its form. Hina then built a shelf from the <i xml:lang="haw">uluhe</i> fern and placed the child upon it. After the child had reached the age when it could
take food, it was given nothing but bananas.

<p>Alanapo was another very sacred place; it was also a temple and was located in the
land of Humuula. It was the resort of spirits and a place noted for the strength and
braveness of the people brought up in it. When Hina saw that the child was full grown
she took him to the temple of Alanapo and brought him up with the spirits, where he
was educated in the arts of warfare and in all the training proper for the development
of great strength. After the years of training his two hands were equally developed
and could deal out death to all his enemies. In his daily life and bringing up, he
had a twofold character; that of a spirit and of a human being.

<p>One half of Kauai at this time was under the control of Namakaokalani, who was constantly
at war with Kaluaopalena [the father of Palila, the ruler of the other half of Kauai].

Namakaokalani, if victorious, would conquer the whole island of Kauai.

<p>It was Hina’s usual custom to go down to observe the progress of the contending parties;
she did this every time there was a battle. On this occasion Hina went down and arrived

will be Palila, your own son, who comes from the temple of Alanapo. He will be the

he will be pleased with you, you will live; but if he gets angry you will be slain

<p>Soon after Hina departed on her way to see the battle, Palila woke from his sleep.
When he looked about him and saw that Hina was not around, he rose, took up his war
club, Huliamahi by name, given to him by the gods, and came out of the sacredness
of Alanapo. He continued on his way until he was outside of the limits of Humuula,
and went through a forest of tall trees until he arrived at a rise looking toward
the sea. This rise is Komoikeanu. When Palila arrived at this rise he looked down
and saw two great armies gathered at Paa. Palila knew by the action of the men that
a battle was about to be fought and against his father Kaluaopalena. He therefore
turned and proceeded along the upper part of Hanapepe through the brush and tall trees.
When Palila got into the forest he swung his club, Huliamahi, knocking down the trees.
By reason of the falling of the trees one on top of another, they kept on falling
until the trees standing around one of the armies were also knocked down, destroying
a large portion thereof, leaving Kaluaopalena’s intact. Those who heard Hina announce
the coming of Palila were all afraid upon seeing the forest mowed down, therefore
Namakaokalani immediately sent his messengers to ask Kaluaopalena to call off the
battle and to make peace.

<p>When Kaluaopalena heard the message, he refused to call the battle off, saying: “I
will not call the battle off until I am victorious, for I have laid awake nights until
my head was made heavy planning for this battle. I know that I will conquer the whole
of Kauai this day.” The reason why Kaluaopalena said this was because he had heard
that Palila was coming to meet him, and it was also this which caused the other side
to sue for peace. On whichever side Palila swung his club no trees or shrubs remained
standing, and none grow to this day.

Lupeakawaiowainiha, another great warrior. It is said that every time he urinated

club was so large that it required one hundred and twenty men to carry it. When he

his head and then down under his chin, causing the people to shout with admiration
at his cleverness; but Kaluaopalena would not call him and he <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-7.htm.html#pb140" class="pginternal">140</a>]</span>was so ashamed that he went home to Hanalei. Kaluaopalena, according to the instructions

order was therefore issued in which everybody was requested to uncover their back.
This was followed by everybody except Kamaikaahui. When he was requested to uncover
his back he at once attempted to escape and ran off, threw down his clothes and jumped
into the sea where he turned into a shark. The place where he left his clothes is
to this day known as Kauhalahala, given to it because he successfully escaped from
the hands of the people.

as he is partly spirit, being so by the influence of Mahinui, his mother. He has been
brought up under strict kapus in the temple of Alanapo by the spirits and is therefore
not quite human.” At this Ahuapau asked: “What are we to do then?” Kahikoluamea replied:
“Put him on the palanquin and let your runners carry him with all haste into the temple,
where he shall be kept under a strict kapu until we have worked over him and have
transformed him into a perfect human being, when everything will be well.” Palila
was then placed in the palanquin and he was carried off by the two runners into the
temple of Kanelaauli, at Kahehuna, without allowing a single breath of wind to strike
him. The king Ahuapau in the meantime walked on the ground for the first time and

<p>There was at this place a large stick of wood to which was given the name of Hooneenuu.
Because of this name, Hooneenuu, Palila took a dislike to Molokai, so he again pushed
out his war club and flew to Kaunolu, Lanai. From this place he crossed over to Kahoolawe
and from there to Pohakueaea in Honuaula. At this place he sat down and rested.
