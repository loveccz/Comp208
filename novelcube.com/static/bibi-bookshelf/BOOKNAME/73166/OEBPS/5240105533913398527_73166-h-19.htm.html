squid fishing all that was necessary to do was to take and expose them and the squids
would come up and enter the canoe. This was Keaau’s regular occupation every day.
The existence of these extraordinary shells was in time carried to Umi, who was then
living in Kona. Whereupon he ordered his messengers to go to the home of Keaau and
obtain possession of them, and at their demand<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-19.htm.html#xd32e10460" id="xd32e10460src">2</a> the shells were given up and the messengers returned with them to the king.

for them. After studying for a time for means of recovering the shells, he one day

could return my shells to me.” The man replied: “You have found him. You sail on until
you come to Makapuu and after you have passed that place steer your canoe for a point
between the bird islands and Mokapu. When you reach that point look for the cliff
which resembles the roof of a house, above, and directly below the cliff you will

<p>After receiving these instructions, Keaau set out, and after he had sailed past the
different points he came to the landing below the home of Iwa. Upon touching land
he looked about him and saw a small boy without his loin cloth running along the beach.
Keaau then called out to him: “Is your name Iwa?” The boy replied: “No, Iwa is at
the house.”<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-19.htm.html#xd32e10493" id="xd32e10493src">5</a> When Keaau arrived at the house he found Kukui, the father of Iwa. Keaau then asked

him your pig.” When Keaau heard this, he returned and said to Iwa: “There, you are
Iwa after all; you misdirected me.” Keaau then took the pig and presented it to Iwa
saying: “Here, I present this to Iwa, the thieving son of Kukui, together with the
articles of value in my canoe and the canoe itself.” Iwa then said to Keaau: “Let
us return to the house.” When they arrived at the house, the pig was killed and put
into the oven, and the awa was prepared. After the meal was over, Iwa turned and asked
of Keaau: “What is the object of your journey that has brought you here?” Keaau replied:
“I had two shells which were taken away from me by orders from the king, Umi, and
he has them in his possession now. I value these shells so much that I am distracted,
and that is the reason of my being present here.” “We must await until tomorrow morning,”

<p>They retired for the night, and on daylight the next day they boarded the canoe and
set out to sea. Iwa took the stern of the canoe with his paddle called Kapahi, while
Keaau took the seat at the bow. After they were seated in the canoe, Iwa called out:
“Kapahi, take Iwa out to sea,” at the same time he dipped his paddle into the sea.
(This meant that one stroke of the paddle was all that was needed.) With this one
stroke, they passed between Niihau and Kauai. Iwa then asked: “Have we arrived?” “This
is not Hawaii, these islands are Kauai and Niihau.” Iwa then turned the stern of the
canoe around and again called out to his paddle, Kapahi: “Kapahi, take Iwa out to
sea.” When Iwa drew his paddle out of the sea they were passing outside of Kawaihoa.
He then asked of Keaau: “Have we arrived at Hawaii?” “No,” said Keaau. Again Iwa took
up his paddle and gave one stroke and they left Molokai and Lanai to their rear and
they went floating between the island of Molokini and Pohakueaea, a point of land
looking <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-19.htm.html#pb288" class="pginternal">288</a>]</span>toward Hawaii. Iwa then asked: “Have we arrived?” “Yes,” replied Keaau, “but it is
at that point of land where the cloud hangs over the mountain that we want to go;
it is to the west of that point that Umi is now living.” Iwa then took up his paddle,
Kapahi, and gave one stroke and they arrived outside of Kalaeakeahole, a point of
land looking towards Kailua, where Umi had his residence. When they looked about them,
they saw Umi just below them, in his canoe. Iwa then said to Keaau: “There is Umi
in his canoe with the shells. Let us get our canoe to the rear and out of sight of
Umi.” When they were some distance from Umi, Iwa said: “Say, Keaau, you must float
right at this spot until I return with your shells.” Keaau therefore kept his canoe
floating on the same spot while Iwa dove down and swam until he had reached the bottom
of the ocean, then walked under water to the place where the canoe of Umi was floating,
then swam up until he was almost up to the surface; and as the shells were being let
down on the side of the canoe, Iwa grabbed them and took them down with him to a large
coral, there he fastened the fish-line, then he took the shells and swam under water
until he reached their canoe and got into it. The two then returned and landed at
Leleiwi, in Hilo, where they made their home. Upon the recovery of his shells Keaau
again took up his favorite occupation, that of squid fishing, taking along his shells,
Kalokuna. The squids at sight of the shells climbed and entered the canoe until it
was loaded down when they returned to shore.

<p>After the shells were taken by Iwa and the line fastened to a coral, Umi after a time
pulled up on his line, but to his surprise it would not yield and thinking that the
line was entangled to the coral he did not wish to pull very strong, thinking the
line would break and he would lose the shells. Fearing he would lose them he remained
in his canoe all day, and that night he slept out at sea with his men, and for some
days he lived there, while his men dove down to untangle the fish-line and thus recover
the much valued shells. Men noted for being able to stay under water a long time were
sent for, and these men were told to go down, but the best they could do was to go
down three times forty fathoms, seven hundred and twenty feet,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-19.htm.html#xd32e10504" id="xd32e10504src">6</a> not deep enough to reach the bottom where the line was tangled. This was kept up
for a week. Umi then sent out his runners to make a circuit of Hawaii to look for
a man who could stay under water long enough to recover the shells. In this trip around
the island of Hawaii, Iwa was found at Leleiwi, the point of land adjoining Kumukahi,
between Puna and Hilo. When Iwa heard the king’s wish through his runner, Iwa said
to him: “There are no shells at the end of the line. The line only is fastened to
some coral in the bottom of the ocean. The shells have been recovered by Keaau.” When
the runner heard this he returned to Umi taking Iwa with him and told Umi of what
he had heard from Iwa. Umi then asked Iwa regarding the shells and Iwa told Umi just
what the runner had told him. At the close of the report Umi asked Iwa: “Can you get
these shells for me if you should go for them?” Iwa replied: “Yes,”<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-19.htm.html#xd32e10507" id="xd32e10507src">7</a> Iwa then journeyed back to the home of Keaau in Leleiwi.

<p>After Umi had told Iwa what he wanted, the sun was past the meridian. Iwa did not,
however, wait for further directions but started out on his way to Waipio. Just before
dusk he arrived at Puuepa and immediately started running and crying out like the
king’s crier with a flag in his hand. He continued running until he reached the cliff
of Puaahuku, looking down into Waipio. In calling out the way he did, the crier, whose
duty it was to make the cry, was forced to go to sleep like the rest of the people,
for to get up and go about meant death. Because of this Iwa was the only one about,
all the people believed it was the usual crier and the crier himself believed that
the king had appointed some one else to take his place. Furthermore the people could
not recognize any difference; the build was the same, the flag looked the same, the
voice sounded the same and the speed in running was the same.

me feel of it.” “Here it is,” answered the old women. “You must come nearer so that
I can touch it with my hand. I just want to feel of it.” When the old women drew nearer
to Iwa, he reached out and pulled at the axe, getting it away from them. The old women
then called out: “Here is a thief! The king’s axe is gone! We are killed! We had thought
this was a good man!” When the people heard this, they all got up and gave chase.
When the old women made the first outcry, Iwa had reached the top of Puaahuku with
the axe in hand. When the pursuers reached there he had reached Mahiki. This chase
was kept up until Iwa reached Puuepa. When those in pursuit reached this place, he
was at Puako. They therefore gave up the chase as the country beyond that place was
outside of the kapued area, while Iwa continued on until he arrived in Kona. He then
slept until daylight the next day. When it was about time for Umi to have his morning
meal, Iwa went up to him. When Umi saw Iwa he asked jokingly: “I don’t think you have
been able to get my axe.” Iwa then replied: “Perhaps not, but I want you to look at
this axe and see if it is not yours.” When Umi saw it, he said: “How strange! I thought
you never would be able to get it; but here you have gotten it. You are smart.” After
this Umi said to Iwa: “Here is my thought regarding you. I want you to try with my
six best thieves. There are two houses to be filled in one night, one for you and
one for them. If you will not be able to fill yours first, you will be killed; so
shall it be with the others.” Iwa then replied: “Yes, no doubt the others will fill
theirs first for there are six of them. Mine will not be filled because I am alone.”

Before he could remove all the things into his house there was no space left, so he
