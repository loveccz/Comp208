meeting her, Namakaeha spoke to her because she was a good-looking woman. Her husband

country, and I am a woman of this place, also a resident of it; you may want to get
me for your wife.” Namakaeha replied to Mahinahina: “I do not desire such between
us, because I have a wife still at Kahiki; but because of my great desire to go traveling,
that is why I have come; I would have passed right on by the main road, only happening

I am only a spirit as you see; because I was much ashamed of Puuhele, therefore, I

“On our way, if Pele should see us first, she wins, but if we should spy her first,
we win.” So they went along, and Namakaeha caught sight of her first and he said to

said Namakaeha, “and also to seek out champions” (for opponents). Pele said: “I had
thought it was a journey for a good purpose, but it is a journey with an evil design.”
While they were talking Lehoula disappeared, and went back to her place. These two
fought until Pele was weakened. The body of Pele was then taken and the bones were
stripped of flesh and taken and buried in the ground. They were exhumed by dogs, placed
in a pile and that was why this hill was so named, because the bones of Pele were
stripped off there. Perhaps others have a different explanation, but this is what
I have obtained by questioning friends concerning this subject. This hill stands on
the east side of Maui, near Hana.

wood was used. But it must be wood which was known to be durable. The posts and the
sills were important timbers, more so than the battens [which may be of any kind of
wood]; the side in the water was braced with wooden posts.

there was a natural division of the water—where some of it flowed on one side and
some on the other side. Then in that case the head of one branch was dammed up and

the effects of an illness. Kalana’s soul, however, went and lived at the source of
the water, and became a large koa tree for the pali of Kalana. Ahakeanui was carried
by the water to the shore of Kunounou. After a while Holu wanted some awa, so he changed
from his stone body and went for some; after he obtained it, he still lacked water.
So he stretched out his legs and with one foot on one side of the precipice and the
other on another side, he trod down and water came forth. Those springs were named
Waipu and Kaluaokapuhi. Holu was carried by the water to the sea; he tore off a part
of his body, and that became the sea oopu, known as <i xml:lang="haw">poopaa</i>. At this time there are no more restrictions on any of these things; the people no
longer go up to worship. No attention whatever is paid to them.

given to the chief as to the source of the birds, then he would be safe; if he should
give a contrary answer, he would be killed. The name of this priest was Luahoomoe,

at all, so they decided to get some shore birds. When they caught some, they daubed
the feathers red with dirt so that the chief would think the birds came from the mountain.
When they returned and handed the birds to the chief, he was exceedingly glad because
he thought the birds came from the mountain. The chief told the men to take them to
the priest for his inspection. The priest perceived, however, that the birds came
from the seashore, so he told the chief that they did not come from the mountain,
but from the seashore. Then the chief said to the priest: “You shall not live, for
you have guessed wrongly.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#xd32e17645" id="xd32e17645src">14</a> I can very well see that these are mountain birds.” Then and there an imu was prepared

<p>When the prophet arrived, these two flew on to the parents-in-law; when the prophet
arrived there, they flew to Kahoolawe, and from there they returned to Hanaula, and
at that place the prophet met them [and offered his sacrifice]; and that was how the
rain was restored. While these sons lived at Hanaula, they thought a great deal of
Puuoinaina, their wife, but they did not know what she was doing. Because after that
Puuoinaina took for her the husband of Pele, Lohiau, and forgot her own husbands.

<p>But when Pele heard what Puuoinaina had done she became angry. She then cursed Puuoinaina.
When Puuoinaina heard this cursing from Pele she felt so ashamed that she ran into
the sea. She left her home, Kohemalamalama, now called Kahoolawe. Pele, residing at
Kahikinui, thought so much of her husband, Lohiau, who was living at Kealia, Kamaalaea,
that she started out to meet him; but she found her way blocked by Puuhele, so she
went from there and waded through the sea. She saw her lizard rival, Puuoinaina, stretching
from Kahoolawe to Makena, so she came along and cut the lizard in two, right in the
middle, separating the tail from the head. The tail became Puuolai at Makena, and
the head became Molokini. When the husbands heard that their wife was dead, they looked
and beheld the head of their beloved standing in the sea, so they called the name
of the islet Molokini. That is the story of how it was born of its parents and how
it obtained this new name Molokini.

<p>Here is the reason why Molokini was detached from Haupu. It was during the battles
of Kana with the chief of Haupu; the latter had taken his mother, and Kana wanted
her released to return to her husband; the husband had felt very badly because his
mate, the wife, was separated from him; he had cast about for a way of getting her
back, but found none. So the father thought that Kana could bring her back, because
he had numerous bodies, and he was born in a queer way. But when Kana went to get
the mother, the hill started to grow upwards and nearly touched the heaven. This was
the reason for it: there were two turtles under the mountain; so when Kana went over
for his mother, the people on the mountain called to the turtle in this manner: “O
Kahakauwila, lift up the hill;” then the mountain would rise until Kana became a dwarf
alongside of it. This was continued until Kana was hungry, because his food had given
out, so he laid down towards Uli, his grandmother, who was residing on Hawaii. She
nourished him until he grew large. When his younger brother saw that Kana’s feet were
plump he said to himself, “Strange! here you have enough to eat and I live in hunger;
I shall cut off your feet.” So he cut off Kana’s feet. Kana said to his grandmother:
“My feet are getting cold.” The grandmother replied: “Yes, your younger brother noticed
that your feet were fat; he became peeved; and that was why he chopped them off.”

<p>Then Kana arose and commenced the fight with his enemy again; the mountain started
to rise because of the call from the people to do so. But when the mountain rose up,
Kana also rose up. They went up together until the hill was lower than Kana. Kana
tipped it, and when the people [on the hill] looked up and saw Kana’s eyes glaring
down at them, they trembled with fear. Kana then trod the hill, and broke <span class="pageNum" id="pb520">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#pb520" class="pginternal">520</a>]</span>it into small pieces; some flew over towards Koolau, Oahu; some were thrown right

It is said that here in Hawaii in the earliest times there was no sea; the land was
exposed. There was not even fresh water, but because she brought the sea it reached
Hawaii. Because Pele was displeased on account of her husband being enticed from her,
she came to Hawaii; her parents gave her the sea, so that when she came she could
bring her canoes. She arrived at Pakuela, and from there she came to Kanaloa where
she poured out the sea from her head, and there and then Hawaii first received the
sea. When the sea broke [on the land] her brothers composed this chant:

midnight, the brother of the wife awoke startled, on account of the great heat; when
he awoke he found that the fire had commenced to burn his feet, and that was really
the reason for his awakening; but the brother-in-law still slept. The fire, however,
had commenced to consume his feet; so he tried to awaken him, but without any success;
the fire burned up to the knee, and he was still trying to awaken the brother-in-law;
he kept this up until his stomach, his breast and his shoulders were consumed. When
the fire reached the neck he ran away. He climbed a hill and when near the top he
heard the head calling: “Let us not go home now; wait until I arrive, then we will
go home together.” But he kept on running; the head meanwhile kept on calling from
behind. He passed one hill and while descending the second hill, the head commenced
to roll after him. At the same time he saw tongues of fire shooting out from the rolling
head. It called again, “O Head! O Head! retard him so that I can catch him.” They
thus raced along until a number of valleys had been passed; and when they reached
the plains above Puulaina he realized that the head was close behind him, so he did
not go by way of Puulaina but made a short cut for the sea by the trail heading for

person running towards us is not caught by that head until he comes up to us, he will
be saved; but if he be caught above here he would be fortunate if he lives.”

<p>Soon after this conversation the prophet appeared. He had gone on until an idea occurred
to him to return, because he realized that if he did not come back then all these
people would be eaten by this god; for the head was not dead; its spirit still lived.
And when he came to where these two were talking he said: “I have returned because
I feared you would all be consumed. Your husband is coming, but it will be when nearing
night; you will then behold your husband coming to you in the same way he usually
appeared. So, do not stay here; all of you go to your brother’s house, and we will
wait there. When he arrives then all of you surround me so that he can not see me;
do you not, however, acquiesce in his request to come back and live with him, because
if you do you will surely die.”

<p>After the prophet was through talking, the woman went and stayed in the house. All
kept awake, however, and at about midnight, they heard the sound of a whistle, and
they knew that he would soon appear; when the whistle sounded again the prophet ran
over to the house where the woman was and said to her: “Should your head of a husband
ask you to give him your son to rear, do not consent; and should he ask you to come
outside do not go outside, else you die.” The real reason for his coming up, however,
was to find out whether or not she was asleep; but when he called, she answered. So
the prophet returned to the house from which he came. Arrived there, he heard another
whistle, and still another, and after that the head arrived at the house and called
out to the wife, “O Kaneikiawaiuli!” The other answered. The head said: “Please come
out here.” Kaneikiawaiuli replied: “I will not come out.” “Why not?” asked the head.

<p>This potato was planted at Manoa, Oahu, on the northwestern slope of Manoa. There
were two potato fields, one for Kupihe and the other for Kapanaia. Kupihe planted
his potato on the side hill while Kapanaia planted his on the flat. When they were
cultivating, only one potato was found in Kapanaia’s field, so he hilled it up. But
the potato grew large and became exposed from the hill in which it was planted; the
field of the other man, however, did not contain any potato. Afterwards they went
to their homes, and on the next day they went up again to cultivate. Kapanaia hastened
to see [his potato], but when he looked there was no lump in the hill; he searched
but could not find the potato. He looked here and there, but he could not find it.
So he went up to Kupihe’s, the field on the hillside. When he looked, he saw this
potato causing a lump in the other’s potato hill, and Kupihe was hilling up the soil.
Kapanaia stood there and asked, “Whose potato is this?” The other answered: “It is
mine, for it is growing in my potato-hill.” After their quarrel over the potato they
returned to their homes. That night the potato rolled down the hill and made a deep
hole where it first struck; from there it bounced and became again attached to its
parent vine. That is one version of the story. But in the story which I heard, it
is stated that the stem of this potato was bitten by a rat and the potato rolled down
until it landed in Kapanaia’s field, and it was left there until new sprouts commenced
to grow from it. That is why new sprouts come from potatoes as we see them now. That
was why this potato at Makiki was called Ualakaa, because it rolled [down hill]. Another
name which I heard [applied to it] was Iolekaa (rolling rat). Another has it that
Kaauhelemoa pecked at the stem of this potato and it rolled to Kapanaia’s field, because
Pupuulima chased after it.

Because of this, Lihau thought to choke the child to death, so that the two of them

them; they were not to live together, nor were they to have any intercourse with others;
but ten days after this order, Eeke again committed adultery with Puuwaiohina above
referred to, who was a younger sister to Lihau. Because of this their god punished
them by making Eeke a mountain and Puuwaiohina a mountain ridge; that is the ridge
prominent at Kauaula. There is, it seems, a hole below the highest point of this ridge.

<p>Formerly there was no hill there, but after Pele arrived, this hill was brought forth.
But it was not given a name at that time; afterwards it was called Puulaina. This
was the reason for so naming it: At that time a chief was living on the other side
of the hill, and because he was tired of seeing it standing there obstructing his
view, and preventing him from seeing the breadfruit grove of Lahaina, he ordered his
men to go and construct a ti-leaf house on its top; and the hill was called Puulai.
And because it was sightly to those viewing it from Lahaina it was called Puulaina.

<p>Moemoe called out sarcastically, “You can not catch the sun for you are a low down
farmer.” Maui answered, “When I conquer my enemy and satisfy my desire I shall kill
you.” He came to Haleakala, and when the sun passed directly over him he snared it
with the coco-husk, and broke some of its rays; he repeated this and broke all the
strong rays of the sun. He said: “I am killing you because you travel so fast.” The
sun requested, “Let me live; you watch how I travel.” He looked and beheld that it
traveled slower, so he desisted from going after it again. That is why the sun goes
slowly. And the name “Haleakala” given to it now is not correct; it should be Alehela,
on account of Maui’s snaring the rays of the sun.

and other things of a like nature. From what I have been told that country <span class="pageNum" id="pb542">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#pb542" class="pginternal">542</a>]</span>from above Kekaa to Hahakea and Wahikuli, that country now covered with cactus in
a northwesterly direction from Lahainaluna, was all cultivated; Kekaa became a city
populated by a great many; this chief [Kaalaneo] also planted the breadfruit and kukui
trees down at Lahaina.

were called the breadfruit trees of Kauheana. This Kaululaau was banished to Lanai,
where ghosts were plentiful, with the idea that he would be killed; but it did not
turn out that way. After some time a fire was seen burning [on Lanai], therefore the
chiefs wondered whether or not Kaululaau was dead on account of this lighted fire.
The important point from these explanations is that Kekaa was the birthplace of Kaululaau,
the famous one who traveled all over Lanai fighting the numerous ghosts there and
made it a land fit to be inhabited by human beings as it is at the present time.

this place is the saying now quoted: “The roaring sea in the presence of Kauiki.”
At the same place, too, are the coconuts of Kane; right makai of this place is a large

a multitude. Afterwards it was killed, and that was why it was called Pueokahi.

<p>Let us leave the ghosts and speak of the prophets. While the prophets were following,
and because Pueonuiokona was the faster, an idea occurred to one of them, and he said
to himself, “If I catch up to that prophet I shall kill him, for he is simply going
after my enemies to save them.” The owl went along slowly until his fellow prophet
thundered after him and gave his hand a jerk. Pueo asked, “What wrong has a fellow
committed that you should tug at the arm from behind and thereby nearly tripping me?”
The other replied with blazing eyes, “Who told you to go after my enemies with the
intention of saving them? Why don’t you look for your own, and on them practice saving?”
The owl replied: “If you excel in strength you can obtain them, but if you are weak
you can not have them; because I, even I, am an old resident of this plain. When spirits
from the dead arrive I cause them to revive. Also no prophet comes to this plain;
this is the first time that I have seen a prophet on this plain, and that is yourself.

fisherman who used to go fishing for them, and he passed long periods at his occupation.
One day Kapokoholua sailed out on the ocean in a canoe to fish. When he had gone Puupehe
commenced a conversation from inside the mother’s womb. When Puupehe spoke the mother
was startled from her sleep, and she wondered at this strange sound which she heard.
She went to sleep again; the live one called out, “Say, my dear mother, do thou awake;
father is dead.” The mother then realized that it was a human voice, but she could
see no human being. She ran quickly and stood at the door of the house and looked
round for the owner of the voice, but she could see no one; she thought, however,
that it was her husband, but she was disappointed. She returned and sat in the house.
The child voiced a chant thus:

I had better explain shortly about his chanting and falsely stating that his father
was dead. It was not true as he chanted. He had gone to watch his father fishing,
and he had sent for a great number of fish to come and bite the hook. He saw that
his father had caught a great many fish, but he needed the second [requisite], the
awa root. He knew his parents had none; that was why he voiced the few lines of song
above written.

While his father was fishing he became very much interested because he caught so many.
When he glanced shoreward he could not see land, because Puupehe had covered it completely
with fog. He thought to himself, “What can this wonderful thing be? There is now no
wind to bring the fog on to the land!” He had a premonition, however, concerning his
wife, so he commenced to pull in his line. When it was near the top his line was held
by a shark. The name of this shark was Puaiki.

at his old fishing ground his line and hook were broken off. He returned and when
near shore he saw his wife standing on the seashore beckoning to him. He said to himself,
“You are unaccountable, my wife; you can see that I am returning.” With one scoop
of his paddle in the sea the bow of the canoe landed on the sand. The wife ran to
him and grasped him tremblingly. He asked, “What is the cause of this heavy breathing?”

who eats; the child only made a pretense of eating; that was what was done when he
asked anything of his parents. When the father had finished eating, the child called
for the second kind of food, that was the tobacco. After smoking the tobacco the child
returned to the womb of the mother. The womb of Kapoiliili became as large as it was
formerly. The wife said, “I think perhaps the child has returned to my womb.” “Why
so?” asked the husband. “I am swelling,” replied the wife. “Do not wonder, because
he is satisfied; he has returned to rest, and when his fullness is lessened he will
go about his business of sightseeing.”

<p>The wife was no longer afraid; perhaps she was a little fearful of her husband. And
when it was nearly morning the child went off again as usual. I will leave this part
until later. I wish to speak of the [number of] months this child was in the womb
of his mother, and the cause of its going about while still in the womb. This child
had been thirteen months in the womb when it acted in a ghostly manner to his mother,
as stated heretofore. They (the parents) had wondered why the child was not delivered,
because the time for the delivery of the child, twelve months, had passed. With their
child there was no birth. In this matter they were greatly in suspense [and were surprised],
because it walked about while still in the womb; its face was not seen; it talked
as if it were a shadow at a distance.

The occupation of these boys was fishing. This was their practice
in fishing while living at Kaupo, Maui: Mauiokalana wished to go fishing; he said
to his elder brothers: “Say, this is a calm day; shouldn’t we sail the sea? for this
is a good day, the sea is calm; this is a day when the tide is not strong in its opposition
for it is flowing in one direction.” When he had finished speaking, Mauimua answered:
“Let us not sail, for this will be a tempestuous day; this calmness which we see is
only in the morning; when the sun rises you will see the waves rise, the wind will
increase, and in a short time we will be obliged to return. Put off your fishing until
a calm day.” Then Mauiokalana spoke again: “Why, I thought because you are the first-born
you knew the signs of the sky, but I see you do not! Your yellow teeth signify nothing.”
Then Mauimua, displeased, answered: “Say, my younger <span class="pageNum" id="pb562">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#pb562" class="pginternal">562</a>]</span>brother, you do not realize that I am the one acquainted with the ways of this place.
This is the sign I know about: when you sleep until near morning, and should hear
the breaking surf above the wind, then it will be calm. That is my sign, that you
may hear, my younger brother. But what of it? let us sail according to your urging.”
<span class="corr" title="Source: Maumua" id="xd32e18462">Mauimua</span> ordered the canoes lifted to the beach. The canoes were taken to the shore, and they
prepared to sail for fishing. When they arrived at the reef they saw a fire burning
on land. Then <span class="corr" title="Source: Mauikolana" id="xd32e18465">Mauiokalana</span> said to his elder brothers: “Say, there is a fire burning; whose fire can this be?”
The others replied: “Whose indeed? Perhaps we had better return so we can cook some
food for us.” “Pshaw! Let us first go and get some fish, then return; so that when
we get back with fish we can broil them, cook the food, and then [we can] sleep well,
being satisfied.” They went on; in no time they had caught some fish. They then returned.
As soon as they arrived at the beach Mauimua left the canoe, and ran to where the
fire was seen burning. Kaalaehuapi<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#xd32e18468" id="xd32e18468src">103</a> saw him so he and the others threw dirt on the fire and smothered it, and flew away.
Mauimua was disappointed; he returned to their house. The others asked, “How about
the fire?” “There is no fire; it is put out; I thought it was man, but it was not;
some mudhens kindled the fire. Our bananas are being stolen.” Because they saw that
their bananas were being stolen they did not go fishing; they hoped the fire would
be kindled again, but it was not lighted. Then they went fishing again. Whenever they
went out fishing the fire would burn. Thus were they harassed, but they could not
get anything, because Kaalaehuapi knew that Maui and Hina had four sons. When they
went fishing Kaalaehuapi counted them; when they were all present it would light the
fire.

<p>But Maui thought of a plan and he said to his brothers, “Say, tomorrow morning you
go fishing; I will remain. You will place our calabash in front where I sit. You will
cover it with kapa. Then you will go to sea.” The others consented and they went.
Kaalaehuapi saw them and counted Mauimua, Mauihope, Mauikiikii, Mauiokalana. He counted
all present, so the mudhens lighted the fire and roasted the bananas. Before the bananas
were cooked, Kaalaehuapi said, “Say, they’re done; Hina’s son is swift.” It was then
Maui jumped to grab and caught Kaalaehuapi. Then he said, “I will kill you, you mudhen.
You folks indeed have the fire and you are hiding it. I will kill you, you mudhen.
Kaalaehuapi said, “If I die, the fire can not be obtained.” The other mudhens called
out, “O Kaalaehuapi, hold on to the fire; do not tell.” Maui commenced to twist the
neck of the mudhen, planning to kill it dead there and then. The mudhen again spoke:
“Grant me life, then you will obtain the fire.” Maui asked, “Where is the fire?” “In
the stalk of the ape leaf.” So he went to rubbing, but it would not light; he asked
again, “Where is the fire?” The other directed: “In the stalk of the taro leaf.” He
again went to rubbing, but it would not light; the stalk of the taro leaf became grooved,
but no fire was produced; that is why the stalk of the ape and the taro leaf has a
groove, because of Maui’s rubbing for fire. Again he asked, “Where is the fire which
you are hiding?” “In the green wood.” He rubbed that, but it would not ignite. Again
he asked. He kept doing this until it <span class="pageNum" id="pb564">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#pb564" class="pginternal">564</a>]</span>came to the dry wood; there he found the fire. When he had produced fire, he rubbed
the head of the mudhen. That is why the mudhen has a red head as we see it now. And
from that time was fire obtained and has been handed down to the present time.

<p>Let us leave off consideration of this brave man and this daring fellow, and speak
of the child in the womb of the mother at Hawaii. When the child was born, a female
prophet saw that this was to be a strong child, and no one who dared him could escape.
The name of this old woman was Kolea, and she lived near the home of the child’s parents.
The child was brought up until he had attained manhood, when <span class="pageNum" id="pb566">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#pb566" class="pginternal">566</a>]</span>the desire seized him to go sightseeing. He said to his father, “I am desiring to
go sightseeing.” The father said: “Where do you wish to travel to?” He replied: “Along
here, somewheres.” The father said: “If you wish to go sightseeing, your sister is
at an island ahead here, at Kauai.” The son asked: “What is the name of the place
where they are living?” The father told him, “At Mana, Kauai.” He waited for some
time. Again the father said, “Should you go, and your sister does not recognize you,
tell her about us, and she will then know you.” He agreed to do so. They lived together
until the aspiring one went on his journey of sightseeing. The father first secured
the club on which their calabashes were hanging, and gave it into the hands of the
lad. He was taught how to cast the spear, until it was seen that he was very proficient.
He then went along, carrying the club with him. He made a circuit of Hawaii. Finding
a canoe about to sail for Maui he went and stood at the landing place. The men of
the canoe saw what a handsome man he was. The names of the owners of the canoe were
Liuliu,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#xd32e18522" id="xd32e18522src">111</a> Makaukau and Aumai. The men said to the lad, “Where are you journeying to?” “Sailing
for Maui; and I came to inquire concerning your canoe; where is it bound?” “We are
sailing for Maui,” they replied. They sailed together and arrived at Maui. Their canoe
landed at Kukui, Kipahulu. He (the lad) came along and slept at Pelekane, Lahaina.
When he found a canoe going to Molokai, he sailed in it and was landed at Halawa,
Molokai. He went sightseeing, and because of the heat of the sun he went in bathing.
The name of the place where he bathed is Hakawai. He left his club on the bank. A
man arrived and took it saying, “I have found something at Hakawai.” Then the lad
said to the man, “You are taking my club; mine is the next [move] when I shall kill
you.” The man had a spear. The lad followed him; when the man threw the spear at the
boy the latter caught it first at the point; in returning it the man was struck in
the pit of the stomach and the spear pierced the back. The lad stuck the butt of the
spear in the ground and impaled the man on it. He kept on his journey. Arriving at
Kaunakahakai his spear was taken by one of the champions of the place to a cave. No
sooner had the other entered the cave than the lad also appeared and asked for his
spear; but it was not given him. He closed the mouth of the cave; when there was a
small opening left, he lighted a fire. On account of the heat in the cave from the
fire, the local champion thrust out the point of the spear. The boy caught and jerked
it, but the tip was already burned. He went along until he found a canoe sailing for
Lanai. He boarded this canoe and met Pololu. He did not tarry long at this place.
He again boarded the canoe which brought him from Molokai and sailed for Oahu, landing
at Ewa. He stayed there for some time, then sailed for Kauai and landed at Wailua,
but kept on until he arrived at Mana. He asked a woman whom he met, “Do you know Kamauoha?”
“Yes; this is his house by which we now stand.” He turned in there; arriving at the
door of the house he noticed that inside the house was full of people. His sister
called, not knowing that this was her brother. She asked, “From where did you come?”
He replied, “I came from Hawaii, seeking for my sister Luukia.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb568">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-36.htm.html#pb568" class="pginternal">568</a>]</span>The other asked who his parents were, and he explained all from the beginning to the
end. So they began to wail. They wailed from that day to night, and all through the
night to the next day. The husband of the sister thought that this was a lover of
hers. Then he told the people to prepare food; at the same time he instructed them:
“When you have prepared food and the finger bowl is set in the middle, I will call
him to come and eat; when he washes his hands in the basin, then I will say this:
‘You are washing your hands; for what purpose?’ When he replies, I will turn to you,
and that will be your cue to deride him.” The food was prepared, as well as the basin
for washing the hands in. The lad was called, and he came; and while washing his hands
the brother-in-law spoke: “You are washing your hands; for what purpose?” The lad
answered, “I was called by those in that corner and this corner to move up to the
middle.” “Is that so? Was this one called to come and eat?” asked the evil-minded
brother-in-law. “No,” replied the others. “How I am shamed!” Without touching the
food, he returned to where he had previously lain, without saying a word to the sister.
