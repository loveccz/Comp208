of Koolauloa and Koolaupoko. Puniakaia was a very handsome man and had not a single
blemish from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet. He was erect, front and
back, and so on the sides. While Puniakaia was living with his parents, a desire to
go fishing came upon him, so he accompanied his mother to the beach and they went
fishing. The kind of fish caught by them was the kind called pauhuuhu,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-8.htm.html#xd32e6607" id="xd32e6607src">2</a> but only one. This fish was brought home alive and was saved by Puniakaia; being
fed and taken care of until it grew to be a very large fish; and to it was given the
name of Uhumakaikai.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-8.htm.html#xd32e6616" id="xd32e6616src">3</a> This fish was the parent of all the fishes. After Puniakaia had brought up Uhumakaikai
until it was full grown, he turned it into the ocean, free from all confinement.

to Puniakaia; the fish reached from way down deep in the sea to the surface, and they
were driven clear up onto the sand. Upon seeing this the people began taking up the
fish; some were salted, some given away to the people, and so on, from the Makapuu
point to the Kaoio point at Kualoa. With all this great number of people taking the
fish, still there was a large number left, there being so many; and the people had
to leave a great many behind and the pigs and dogs ate of them. Rumors of this great
catch were soon carried to the hearing of Kaalaea,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-8.htm.html#xd32e6640" id="xd32e6640src">4</a> a very beautiful woman, who had no equal in all the land of Koolau; she was just

<p>In this discussion the husband of the woman, who had accompanied Puniakaia to the
beach heard it and so said: “Make a wager against him.” Wagers were then made; but
Puniakaia said: “Say, I am not going to wager my bones against worthless articles.
If I must wager my bones I want to wager them against four large pieces of land; one
for my back; one for my front; and two for my sides.” This was acceptable, and fifteen
days were allowed Puniakaia in which time he must catch the amount of fish boasted
by him.

<p>After the agreement was made, Puniakaia lived on for eleven days without once making
a move about catching any fish. On the eleventh day, however, he saw a canoe being
prepared to sail for Oahu, manned by men from different districts of Oahu; some were
from Waianae and some were from Kaumakapili. When Puniakaia saw this he said to the
men: “When you get to Waianae, those who belong to that place remain there; then I
wish you two who are going to Kaumakapili to go up Nuuanu and when you get there look
down to Kaneohe. You will see my house with the door open. Go down to it and when
you find my mother, Halekou, tell her that her son, Puniakaia, has sent her word to
go and call his fish Uhumakaikai to urge forward the fish to Kauai, because in three
days the time allowed him to catch a certain amount of fish would expire; and failing
to get this fish he will be killed by being cooked in an umu.”

Halekou then asked the men: “What has brought you here?” The men replied: “We have
come on the request of a boy by the name of Puniakaia.” When Halekou heard this, she
wept as well as the chiefs and common people, and said: “We thought that Puniakaia
was dead; but we see now that he is still alive. What has he requested you to do?”
“He told us that we come and tell you that you go and call for his fish, Uhumakaikai,
and request that it drive some fish to Kauai; because Puniakaia made a wager with
the king of Kauai, that in fifteen days he could catch a certain amount of fish, and
that if this amount of fish was not caught within this given time, Puniakaia would
be killed. Now this is the twelfth day and we have only three days left if Puniakaia
is to be saved.” When Halekou heard this, she said: “I am afraid the fish will not
obey my call; for he is the only one that could make the fish do his bidding; but
I shall go and try.”

<p>Soon after this Maniniholokuaua arrived and approached the canoe. He then patted the
sides of the canoe and said: “My canoe, my canoe. I will own this canoe, I will own
this canoe.” Keliimalolo answered: “Leave my canoe alone; don’t take it. Leave my
canoe alone; don’t take it.” While Keliimalolo was talking, Maniniholokuaua lifted
the canoe on his back with everything it contained and ran off at great speed. Keliimalolo
upon seeing this came out of the water and chased after the thief; but he was not
able to catch up with Maniniholokuaua. As soon as Maniniholokuaua arrived at the cave,
he called out: “Open up, O cave.” The cave opened and Maniniholokuaua entered with
the canoe. As soon as he was within, he again called: “Close up, O cave,” and the
mouth of the cave was closed. No sooner than this was done when Keliimalolo arrived
on the outside of the cave and began feeling for an opening; but after hunting in
vain he returned heavy hearted.

<p>Because of this loss of his canoe, he immediately returned to Oahu and soon after
set out for Kauai, in search of some one who would be able to return him his canoe.
He wished to get a good runner. On this trip to Kauai he first landed at Mana; after
he landed he carried his canoe ashore and went for a swim. Upon coming to the pool
he disrobed and jumped in. Just as he got into the water, Kamaakamikioi and Kamaakauluohia
arrived from Niihau. They were the sons of Halulu. These two men were noted for their
fleetness and could make ten circuits of Kauai in one day. Being very swift they could
run on land and sea and from the earth to the skies. They were greater runners than
either Keliimalolo or Maniniholokuaua. As soon as they arrived at the pool they picked
up the malo of Keliimalolo and ran away with it. Keliimalolo got out of the pool and
started to chase the two to try and recover his malo; but he could not catch up with
them. The two ran out onto the sea, on the surface, and when at some distance from
the shore they stood and looked at Keliimalolo. Keliimalolo <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-8.htm.html#pb166" class="pginternal">166</a>]</span>then called out to them, saying: “You two come ashore and let us be friends.” After
the two had come ashore Keliimalolo said to them: “You two will be the means of restoring
to me what I have lost.” He then related to them his trip to Molokai and how his canoe
was stolen by Maniniholokuaua. After the two had listened to the narrative, they said
to Keliimalolo: “You return to Oahu and in the nights of Kane, we will come. When
you see two narrow pointed clouds hanging in the horizon make sure that the clouds
are ourselves and we will come soon after that.” The two then asked Keliimalolo: “Let
us all make a circuit of Kauai in one day.” This was consented to by Keliimalolo.

<p>Early the next morning they set out on their trip around Kauai. Kamaakamikioi and
Kamaakauluohia soon made their first round and overtook Keliimalolo who was still
in the course of finishing the first ahupuaa. The two made another round and again
overtook Keliimalolo, who was in the second ahupuaa. They made ten rounds of the island
of Kauai by evening of the same day; but Keliimalolo was not able to make one round.
They were indeed great runners, having no equal. That night they retired together,
and on the next morning Keliimalolo set out on his return to Oahu, where he awaited
the arrival of his two friends.

<p>On the approach of the nights of Kane, Keliimalolo saw two pointed clouds hanging
in the horizon; and very soon after this Kamaakamikioi and Kamaakauluohia arrived.
They then boarded a double canoe and set out for Molokai. At dawn of that morning
they arrived at Kaunakakai and carried their canoe ashore; at the place where Keliimalolo
left his canoe on his previous visit. They then set out for the pool to take a bath.
While the canoe was still in mid-ocean, Maniniholokuaua looked and saw a canoe approaching;
so said to his grandmother, Kalamaula: “There is my canoe, there is my canoe.” Kalamaula
replied: “You must not attempt to steal that canoe as I have a premonition that the
sons of Halulu of Niihau are on that canoe. If they are on that canoe we will be killed.
I have no regrets for myself for I am old; but I am sorry for you, for you are yet
young.”

<p>Maniniholokuaua then set out for the landing. When he got to the place where the canoe
was lying, he patted the sides and said: “My canoe, my canoe.” Keliimalolo upon seeing
Maniniholokuaua said to his friends: “There is the boy.” Keliimalolo then called out:
“Leave my canoe alone; you must not take it.” Heedless of the call, Maniniholokuaua
took up the canoe, placed it on his back and ran off at the top of his speed. <span class="corr" title="Source: Kamaamikioi" id="xd32e6830">Kamaakamikioi</span> then said: “I am going after that fellow. If you see a fire burning, it is a sign
that I have killed him; you may then come up.” As Maniniholokuaua was almost up to
the cave, Kamaakamikioi caught up with him. Maniniholokuaua then called out: “Open
up, O cave,” and Kamaakamikioi thereupon called out: “Close up, O cave.” No sooner
than the cave was opened it immediately closed again catching Maniniholokuaua and
the canoe in its jaws, killing Maniniholokuaua. Kamaakamikioi then called out: “Open
up, O cave.” The cave opened and he entered in. He found Kalamaula and she was killed.
When he looked about the cave he saw that it was filled with canoes of every description
and many things of great value. He then went out of the cave to light the fire, and
when the people saw it they all came up to the cave and carried away the valuables;
but the people of the whole of Molokai were unable to carry away all of the things
in the cave.
