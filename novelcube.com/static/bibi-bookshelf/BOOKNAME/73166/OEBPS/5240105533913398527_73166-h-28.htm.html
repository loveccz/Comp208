cunning and use words of deception in whispers. The sound of his voice was like that

adjoining Niulii, where Wakaina sang and deceived the people.

<p>Because he was so taken up with this profession he traveled until he came to Kau,
in Hawaii, where he met two young men whom he had beaten in former contests and from
whom he had won several wagers. Therefore, against the time Kapunohu should meet them,
they prepared an oven of hot stones and had baked some potatoes over the fire. After
the potatoes were cooked the oven was covered. Some time after this was done, they
saw Kapunohu on his way to call on them. Upon seeing Kapunohu the older brother said
to his younger brother: “Here comes Kapunohu,” and they began to remove the covering
from the oven and again recovered it, making believe that it was just being covered
up for the first time. While they were doing this, Kapunohu entered the house. When
they saw that Kapunohu had entered the house, they took up the potatoes that had been
baked over the fire and began eating. While they were eating, the older brother <span class="pageNum" id="pb420">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-28.htm.html#pb420" class="pginternal">420</a>]</span>addressed the younger brother, saying: “I believe the food in our oven is cooked.”
The younger brother replied: “Yes.” The two then made preparations to uncover the
oven. When Kapunohu saw them doing this, he remarked: “How can that be possible?”
The two replied: “It is cooked, let us uncover the oven.” Kapunohu grew very stubborn
and said: “The food is not cooked, because you had just completed covering it when
I entered. How can it be cooked? You two are indeed deceitful.” Because Kapunohu was
so stubborn, a wager was proposed and accepted, and the oven was uncovered. As soon
as this was done, it was found that the food was indeed cooked, and Kapunohu was for
the first time beaten by the two young men.
</p>
<p>Some time after this, the two young men prepared something else. This time they procured
a chicken and cooked it in an oven. They next took some eggs and used the shells for
a plaiting on the outside of a [fish or] meat calabash. After the egg-shell calabash
was completed, they took the cooked chicken and placed it in it, and then put the
thing away to await the coming of Kapunohu. Not very long after this Kapunohu was
seen coming to make another call on them. When they saw him coming they took the egg-shell
calabash and made as though they were going to prepare a meal. When Kapunohu came
in and saw that they were about to begin a meal, he asked them: “Here you two are
ready for your meal, but where is your meat?” The two made reply: “We have chicken
for meat and chicken for a calabash.” Kapunohu denied this, saying: “You two are deceiving
yourselves. Who has ever said that you can have chicken for meat and at the same time
have chicken for a calabash. You two are indeed deceitful.” This debate was kept up
until finally wagers were made and after this was settled, the two brothers proceeded
to uncover the egg-shell calabash, in which the cooked chicken was kept. After these
different things had been shown to Kapunohu, he admitted that he was beaten, so the
two brothers took the wagers. This was the second time that Kapunohu was beaten by
the brothers.

they took up their calabashes and uncovered them and then began their meal, dipping
their fingers into the gravy, licking their fingers and taking some poi. When Kapunohu
saw this he said: “Here you are eating your food, but where is your fish?” The two
replied: “We are eating the food and the fish is human flesh.” Kapunohu replied: “You
two are deceiving yourselves. How can you make out that you are eating human flesh?”
The two, however, insisted that what they said was indeed the truth. After much discussion
wagers were made, and when this was settled one of the brothers said: “The food is
of course plain enough; but the fish is our fingers, for we are dipping our fingers
into the gravy without fish, therefore, the fish is human flesh.” Kapunohu admitted

<p>One day he walked down to a stream of water and while he was drinking a ghost came
to the cliff above the place where he was taking his drink and looked down at Lepe.
This ghost happened to be baldheaded. When Lepe looked up and saw the baldheaded ghost,
he called out: “As the drum was beating, up came a baldhead; had there only been two,
what a beautiful sight it would be.” The ghost replied: “If that is what you want,
Lepe, you can have two.” At this up came another baldheaded ghost. Lepe then repeated
what he had said, adding another ghost, until ten baldheaded ghosts stood on the cliff.
With this number, Lepe addressed them saying: “Say, you must be hungry?” “Yes, we
are hungry.” Lepe again said: “Then wait here while I go home and bring the remnants
of my last meal.” Lepe then returned to the house, took up the calabash and excreted
into it, then he urinated into the calabash and stirred up the mixture with a stick.
He then took up the coconut shell dish containing some salt and went back to the place
where the ghosts were waiting for him, carrying the calabash and the salt dish. When
Lepe came up to the ghosts, they took the calabash and stuck their fingers into it
and ate the food, and said: “Oh, my, how bad this food does smell and how awfully
bitter it is!” Lepe replied: “You see I am all alone by myself, and being alone, I
eat my food from the time it is fresh and sweet until it turns sour on me, before
I finish it. If I had such a large company as you are with me, why the food would
be finished while it is still fresh, and it would not turn sour in the calabash.”
With this the ghosts continued on eating until the whole mixture in the calabash was
finished. After the mixture had been consumed, Lepe called out: “Serve you right,
you have all eaten the dung of Lepe.” When the ghosts heard this, they all became
angry with Lepe, and said: “We are going <span class="pageNum" id="pb424">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-28.htm.html#pb424" class="pginternal">424</a>]</span>to kill you for this.” Lepe replied: “If you should kill me you will not have anybody

<p>While they were preparing the pig for the umu, Lepe saw them in their preparations
and knew that a feast was about to be given; he therefore began to evolve a plan whereby
he would be able to eat some of the pork. After hitting on a plan he went to work
to carry it out and so procured some charcoal and began to blacken one side of his
body from top to bottom, leaving one side. When this was completed he went up to the
house where the ghosts made their home. As he was drawing near the house, one of the
ghosts said: “Say, that fellow looks like Lepe, only this fellow is black on one side.”
Another ghost said: “That fellow is not Lepe for he is black on one side, Lepe is
different.” When Lepe arrived, the ghosts asked him: “Are you the only one who has
come?” Lepe replied: “No, there are ten of us black fellows. I am the tenth, and the
other nine fellows have not come yet, but they are coming later on, however; they
will be here directly.”

<p>After the pig was cooked, they all sat down to eat, Lepe included. After the meal,
Lepe got up and went away, and when he was at some distance from the house, he called
out: “I have fooled you. Lepe has eaten of your pig. I am Lepe.” One of the ghosts
then said to the others: “We have been deceived by Lepe. Here it turns out that this
black man is Lepe after all.” The ghosts then began chasing Lepe with the idea of
killing him because they were very angry. While they were chasing, Lepe ran to his
house and began calling out in a loud voice: “Say, you people who are sleeping, you
must wake up for here are some people coming who wish to kill us.” With this he reached
and took hold of the end of a cord and pulled on it. To this cord several rattlers
were fastened and when he gave a pull the rattlers made quite an uproar. When the
ghosts heard this queer noise they all ran away calling out to themselves: “Say, we
will be killed. Here, Lepe’s house is full of people all the time and we did not know
it. What a narrow escape we have had. Let us get away from him.” And they kept on
running.

to the beach house where Kahaookamoku and his followers were all sound asleep. The
