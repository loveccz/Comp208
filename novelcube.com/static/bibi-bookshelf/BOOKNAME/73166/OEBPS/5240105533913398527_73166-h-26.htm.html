all those who opposed him on Hawaii, Maui, Oahu and Kauai. He was so fearless and
strong that he fought against multitudes who opposed him and won out in all his battles.

<p>When Kepakailiula reached the age of twenty years, it was seen that he was very handsome
and pleasant to look upon. He was without blemish; he was perfect from the soles of
his feet to the crown of his head. Because of this great beauty, Kiinoho sent Kiihele
to travel around Hawaii in search of a wife for Kepakailiula.

<p>Kiihele was a very fast runner and could make three complete circuits of the island
of Hawaii in one day. Starting from Paliuli he went first through the district of
Hilo, where he found Kukuilauania, a very beautiful woman, but her eyes bulged out,
so he left her and continued on his way to Hamakua; then on to Waimea and then to
Kohala. From this point he retraced his steps and returned to Paliuli in Puna. When
he arrived home his older brother, Kiinoho, asked him: “How was your journey? Have
you not found a wife in all your journey?” “No, not one,” said Kiihele. Kiinoho then
said to him: “You go toward the rising of the sun, toward Puna.” Kiihele assented
to this and started out. All this was on the same day.

<p>On his journey through Puna, he met a very beautiful woman, Kahala by name. She was
indeed beautiful; her eyes were beautiful and her form was beautiful to look upon;
but she had one fault, her posterior was covered with large lumps, like the kind of
hala seeds seen today. Kiihele left Puna and entered into the district of Kau where
he found Manienie, another beautiful woman; but her one defect was that her hips were
deformed so that she crawled about on her hands and feet, like the manienie [grass]
that is now growing. Kiihele then left Kau and entered into Kona, where he found Makolea,
a very beautiful woman and very pleasant to look upon. She was without blemish and
was so beautiful that she was like the full moon.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-26.htm.html#xd32e13842" id="xd32e13842src">4</a>

Makolea, take our mats and spread them outside of the out house, and after you have
done that come and help me to the place.” After he had given this order, Makolea and
her maids came to the outside of the out house with the mats and spread them out.
After this was done the women went in to get Kakaalaneo. After they were gone on their
errand Kepakailiula went up to the place where the mats were spread and excremented
and urinated on the mats and then went and hid himself. When Kakaalaneo was brought
to the mats he stepped on the filth and fell, making him very angry with Makolea and
the women. He then called out to move the mats over to the stern of the canoes. Makolea
did as she was told and had the mats moved to the stern of the canoes, where they
went and slept for the night. After a time Kakaalaneo became so overcome with the
influence of awa that he fell asleep. Kepakailiula then came and took Makolea into
some bushes and spent the night there together. After sleeping for some time, Makolea
awoke and began to weep, believing that Kepakailiula would be killed by Kakaalaneo.

the king, Kakaalaneo, was then living with the chiefs and people.

you all to float here out at sea and I will go ashore alone. If you look and see that
I am killed, you can turn around where you are and return to Hawaii. But if I should
live, then come ashore.” Kepakailiula then went ashore taking his war club along with

the pohuehue vines and then over the alaalapuloa.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-26.htm.html#xd32e13939" id="xd32e13939src">17</a> Kakaalaneo came out to meet him, carrying two small spears, one in his right hand

manner: “My spear shall eat of your flesh this day, for my spear never misses a grass
blade, an ant or a flea.” After this Kakaalaneo asked: “Who shall have the first chance?
Shall it be the son of the soil or the stranger?” Kepakailiula replied: “Let the son
of the soil take the first chance and the stranger the last.” Kakaalaneo then threw
the spear that was in his right hand at Kepakailiula. When the spear came near Kepakailiula,
he opened out his elbow and allowed the spear to enter in between the arm and the
body, and when it was half way through he brought his arm to his body and held the

blows down houses? Or was it the awa leaf wind of Hana? for my spear has indeed missed
its mark. That spear from my right hand has missed; there yet remains the spear in

spear that was in his left hand, and as it came flying toward Kepakailiula, he opened
out the left elbow a little bit causing the spear to enter between the arm and body,

From this last place they again set sail, landing at Kapueokahi in Hana, Maui, where
Kepakailiula was staying. As soon as the canoes effected a landing the voyagers went
in search and inquired as to the whereabouts of Kepakailiula; they were told that
his house was on the east side of the Kauiki hill. When the people from Oahu arrived
at the house, they met Kepakailiula, who greeted them and they in turn extended theirs.
After resting awhile they told Kepakailiula the object of their mission, saying: “We
have come for you to sail for Oahu. Your father, Kakuhihewa, requests you go to Oahu
and take possession of that island. The canoes are here; all you have to do is to
board them and we will set sail.” Kepakailiula assented<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-26.htm.html#xd32e13993" id="xd32e13993src">25</a> to this; whereupon he and his company, consisting of his foster fathers, Kiihele

refused to take the men, saying: “I do not want to travel in state, for my wife has
been taken away from me secretly, so I want to travel in secret. All I want from you
is a small canoe.” Kakuhihewa therefore gave him a small canoe, as requested. Kepakailiula
then set sail for Kauai, and on the morning of the next day he reached Waimea. As
soon as he landed he took his canoe and broke it into pieces, then after this was
done he went to the first house he saw, where lived one of the chiefs of Kauai, Kaunalewa
by name, a very rich and honored man. When Kaunalewa saw the goodly appearance of
Kepakailiula he called him, and when he arrived before him he urged that they become
friends, saying: “I want you to become my friend and whatever you request of me I
will grant it.”

<p class="first">All this time Kepakailiula had his eye on the oven and when he saw that it was sufficiently
heated, he gave the answer to the first half, saying: “It is a ‘house.’ The house
is plaited all around from top to bottom and an opening is left for the door.” Kepakailiula
again looked at the oven, and when he saw that the stones were being placed on the
edge, he gave the answer to the second half, saying: “The answer to the second half
is also ‘house.’ The posts of a house are first made to stand up, then the battens
are laid down and then the grass and cords are folded and fastened down.” At this
Kaikipaananea asked him: “Who has informed you of the answer to my riddle?” While
he was asking the question, he was caught and thrown into the oven and Kukaea held
him down. While he was being held in the umu, he called out to the chiefs and warriors
of Kauai, saying: “Say, are you then to look on unconcernedly while I am being put
to death?” The chiefs and warriors of Kauai then jumped on Kepakailiula and attempted
to kill him, Kepakailiula then took them as they came and broke them like twigs. Kukaea
and Kaunalewa also jumped in and helped Kepakailiula, thus making three on their side.
