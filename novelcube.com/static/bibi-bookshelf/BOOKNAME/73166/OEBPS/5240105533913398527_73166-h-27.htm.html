<p>When Aiohikupua and his companions came ashore in Kohala they proceeded up to see
the wrestling. When they arrived at the grounds, Ihuanu came out and challenged: “Who
is to come from that side and meet me, wrestling?” No one was seen to come and accept
the challenge because they were all afraid of him. After this Ihuanu turned to Aiohikupua
and said: “Say, stranger, you had better join in the fun.” When Aiohikupua heard the
invitation he went up to Ihuanu and said: “Say, son of the soil, you have asked me
to join you in the fun, and this is what I wish to say to you: Get two others beside
yourself on your side, making three of you. With that number the stranger will feel
it worth while to join you.” When Ihuanu heard this from Aiohikupua, he made reply:

you unless you have three on your side. And what do I care for you and the people
that have gathered here? I can turn this crowd into nothing with my left hand.” Because
of these words of Aiohikupua, one of the strong men in Kohala who had come to witness
the games came up behind Aiohikupua and said to him: “Say, don’t get Ihuanu angry,
for he is the strongest man in Kohala; there is nothing kept away from him when he
asks.” At this Aiohikupua pushed him to one side<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-27.htm.html#xd32e14331" id="xd32e14331src">3</a> whereby the man was killed. Upon seeing this, one of the warriors came up behind
Ihuanu and said to him: “Say, Ihuanu, we see that our side will not be victorious
this day. I am sure the stranger will win out, because one of our companions is killed
by just receiving a mere push. Therefore I beg of you that the crowd be dispersed
and the games brought to an end and you withdraw your challenge and meet the stranger
in a kindly way and shake hands, and in that way save yourself.”<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-27.htm.html#xd32e14334" id="xd32e14334src">4</a> By these words the hot anger in Ihuanu was <span class="pageNum" id="pb408">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-27.htm.html#pb408" class="pginternal">408</a>]</span>rekindled, and so he replied: “Say, my men, don’t be afraid because of the death of

to strike at me?” Ihuanu replied: “I will not strike you. I want you to strike at

to his side and said to him: “If he should again ask you to strike him do it,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-27.htm.html#xd32e14372" id="xd32e14372src">10</a> because this is the proper time.” Shortly after this Aiohikupua again requested of

struck at his opponent, hitting him just below the chest so strong that the fist of
Aiohikupua went clear through and came out at the back. Aiohikupua then raised up
his arm, with the body of Ihuanu on it, twirled the body around over his head and
then threw it outside of the rows of people that were standing around. At sight of
this great strength a mighty shout came from the people and after this they began
to disperse. After this Aiohikupua went over to the place where the body of Ihuanu
