<p class="first">Kahikinui, in Maui, is the land in which Pamano was born; in the village of Kaipolohua.
Lono was the father of Pamano and Kanaio was the mother. The brother of Kanaio was
Waipu. Pamano had two sisters who were born before him, but they both died in their
infancy and Pamano was the only one that was successfully brought up by the parents.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-21.htm.html#xd32e10822" id="xd32e10822src">1</a> When Pamano was full grown he began to study the arts of the hula and the oli (or

<p>The reputation of Pamano as a singer and a chanter, after a time, spread over the
land of his birth and at last it reached Koolau,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-21.htm.html#xd32e10827" id="xd32e10827src">2</a> in the uplands of Mokulau, located in the middle of Kaupo. When Pamano arrived at
that place he was seen by Kaiuli, the king of Maui, and Pamano being a handsome fellow,
he was adopted by the king as a son,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-21.htm.html#xd32e10830" id="xd32e10830src">3</a> and in this way he became known as the brother of Keaka, the only daughter of Kaiuli.
By being adopted Pamano was virtually made king of Maui. The first command given Pamano
by Kaiuli was this: After calling for Pamano and his daughter Keaka to come to him,
he said: “Where are you, my two children? I want you to listen to what I have to say.
I want you, Pamano, to be good and not to touch your sister; and I want you, Keaka,
to be good and not to touch your brother. If you two wish to go surf riding, each
of you can go down and have your surf riding and then return straight home. Pamano
must not enter the house of Keaka or you will die; and so with Keaka.”

<p>It was Pamano’s custom to go down surf riding at Mokulau every day. Keaka on the other
hand had moved to Mokulau and she was at this time living there with her guardian,
a man by the name of Koolau, a close friend of Pamano’s. In these daily trips down
to enjoy the surf something happened one day which led to difficulties. This day,
after Pamano and Koolau had finished bathing, they started on their return, and while
on their way, in passing by the house of Keaka, she called out to them: “Come and
get some fish for you two.” Upon hearing the call the two stood and looked at her.
Keaka continued calling and beckoning them to come to her. The two therefore approached
the wall surrounding the house and called out to Keaka: “Give us our fish.” She replied:
“The fish have no legs. You two who have legs must come and get the fish yourselves.”

fish, at the same time calling for one of them to come in and get them. The two stood
there hesitating, not knowing what to do. She called again, whereupon Pamano reached
and seized the fish, but Keaka jumped and held Pamano and then closed the door and
fastened it. Koolau stood on the outside at the end of the house.

<p>Long before this Keaka had a longing desire to make advances on Pamano, for she was
in love with him and, too, she thought that he would make her a good husband; besides,
he was such a handsome fellow. At last her chance came and all her hopes were realized.
At first they argued,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-21.htm.html#xd32e10839" id="xd32e10839src">4</a> but did not lie together, for Pamano said to Keaka: “I have vowed with Koolau that
before I take a wife he must first have her; and this promise also holds good with
him; before he takes a wife, I must first be favored; therefore we must call him in
to fulfill the vow.” “No; [said she] why should we leave the matter to him, for who
is he? Didn’t I bring up the shameless little thing? I will not call him in.”
</p>
<p>While the two were talking, Koolau awaited for the opening of the door and for the
call for him to enter, for it was raining at the time. After waiting for some time,
he chanted the following lines:

<p class="first">Pamano then made reply: “You know, it was Keaka. After you came away we passed the
evening together.” At the reply Koolau arose and went up to inform Kaiuli thereof.
While he was on his way up, however, Kaiuli looked at him but was unable to recognize
him; so he turned to his companions and asked: “Who is that coming up here?” Some
one replied: “It is Koolau.” “No, that is some one else,” said another. This was kept
up until Koolau was almost up to them, when their doubts were entirely removed, for
they could plainly see that it was he. As he stood in their presence, Kaiuli asked
him: “What has brought you up here so early?” “Yes, I came early because I have something
to say. The chief and chiefess who live in the lowlands have sinned.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-21.htm.html#xd32e10881" id="xd32e10881src">6</a> Pamano has gone and slept with Keaka. That is the reason why I came up, that you
should hear.” Kaiuli then asked of Waipu: “How about your nephew? Shall he live or
die?” Waipu replied: “He shall die.” “What fault have you to cause his death?” asked
Kaiuli. “There is a fault. When he becomes king of Maui, and the bundles of kapued
kapas and loin cloth are brought out, I will get the covering for my kapa and the
binding will be my loin cloth.<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-21.htm.html#xd32e10884" id="xd32e10884src">7</a> Therefore he shall die.” Kaiuli then asked him: “By what means shall he be killed?”
“By the use of the awa,” replied Waipu, “for he is very fond of awa.” The preparations
of the awa were then commenced. The calabashes were filled, the water gourds were
filled, the fish calabashes were filled, and when all the awa was prepared Kaiuli
asked of Waipu: “Who will go and bring Pamano?” “I will,” said Waipu.

on a tour of sightseeing. In their travels in other lands, Pamano and his sisters,
met a prophet who said that Pamano possessed the body of a ghost. And because of a
violent dispute between the prophet and some of the people he procured an ape leaf
and spread it out on the roadway and said to the people: “If after I spread the ape
leaf on the road and he should step on it and does not tear it then the body is that
of a ghost; but if it tears, then he has a human body.” In all this Pamano was aware
of the test. After spreading out the ape leaf the prophet said to the people: “Now
watch him.” Pamano upon coming to the ape leaf<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-21.htm.html#xd32e10992" id="xd32e10992src">15</a> stepped on it and rubbed it with his feet tearing the leaf. When the people saw that
the ape leaf was torn, they turned to the prophet and told him that he was trying
to deceive them. After this the prophet followed Pamano. When the sisters of Pamano
saw that the prophet was following their brother, they allowed an evil spirit to enter
the prophet and he became a mad man.

for the chanter, weeping at the same time, for she was aware that none knew these
chants save Pamano and herself. After a time she found him. Pamano then said to her:
“I will never be your husband as long as Kaiuli, Waipu and Koolau are alive. After

start an oven; and after it was heated, the three, Kaiuli, Waipu and Koolau were all
