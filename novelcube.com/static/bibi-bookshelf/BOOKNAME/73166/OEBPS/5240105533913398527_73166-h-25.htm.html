<p>Kihapiilani, after being insulted by his brother, took it into his mind to leave Maui
and go to Hawaii to see his brother-in-law, Keawenuiaumi, who was the husband of Piikea,
his sister.

<p>The cause of the battle that was fought sometime after this was because the salt water
from a dish of fish was thrown into the eyes of Kihapiilani by his older brother,
the king who was then reigning over Maui.

<p>When the capture of the hill was completed, Umi ordered Omaokamau to go and fight
Imaikalani. When Omaokamau heard this he proceeded to the home of Imaikalani. When
Omaokamau was drawing near the home of Imaikalani the birds sounded a note. At this
note of warning from the birds Imaikalani said to his men: “Say, there is a man.”
The men said: “There is nobody.” Imaikalani remarked: “Watch out.” While the two men
were watching, Omaokamau soon after appeared. The men then said to Imaikalani: “Yes,
there is a man, he is coming, and he carries a war club in his hand.” Imaikalani said:
“That is Omaokamau, one of the warriors of Umi; he is well versed in the art of throwing
the spear; his main strength is in his right arm, his left is weak; watch him and
see when he twirls his war club.”

other. Omaokamau struck his club to his right, but somehow Imaikalani warded off the
blow by the use of his club and the first blow aimed by Omaokamau missed. They again
twirled their clubs and after a time Omaokamau struck to his left, but again his blow
was warded off and he again missed Imaikalani. After this second miss Omaokamau turned
around and returned to Umi. When he came up to Umi, Umi asked him: “How was your trip
to the home of Imaikalani?” Omaokamau replied: “I don’t know what to say. The eyes
of Imaikalani are both sightless but his thinking powers are faultless. I fought him
for a time, but he warded off my blows so skilfully that I was afraid of him and so
I came back.”

I am the one that is of consequence.” Koi then started off and went as far as the
place where the birds were stationed. When he heard the birds give the note of warning,
which was also heard by Imaikalani, he was puzzled to know what this meant. When Imaikalani
heard the notes of the birds he sent his two men to go and see who it was. When the
men came out they saw a man, so they reported to Imaikalani: “It is a large man with
dark skin and the hair on his head is curly.” Imaikalani replied: “That is Koi; he

club and let it come down on his left, but again he was foiled. When Koi saw that
he could not get the best of Imaikalani, he turned around and returned to Umi. When
he came in the presence of Umi, Umi asked him: “How did you get along with your trip
to Imaikalani?” Koi replied: “No warrior can stand before Imaikalani, for I have seen
him with my own eyes. What Omaokamau has said and all the things which we have heard
are perfectly true, and I must therefore give the same report. After I had twirled
my club once on the second time I struck at Imaikalani, but from what I could see
it was as nothing to him. After the first blow I gave him another one but that, too,
was as nothing to Imaikalani. I therefore became afraid and returned.” While Koi was
giving his account of the encounter, Piimaiwaa spoke up to Koi: “The bones of a youngster
like you could not be old enough; here are the bones that are well matured.” Piimaiwaa
then stood up, took up his club and started off. When he came up with Imaikalani,
he heard the birds. His appearance was then reported by the men to Imaikalani, that
another warrior was coming. As Piimaiwaa stood in the presence of Imaikalani, Imaikalani
stood up ready to defend himself. After trying his skill against Imaikalani Piimaiwaa
saw that he was unable to best his opponent, so he too returned to the king and told
him of what he had done, which was the same thing reported by Omaokamau and Koi.

said: “He can be slain, it can be done easily. It will not take much of an exertion.”
Omaokamau then asked him: “Will you tell me how it can be done?” The man then said

not to the king, not to his own brothers nor to any other person. “If you should hear
or know that I have broken my promise, then my life shall be forfeited,” continued
Omaokamau. Because of this promise made by Omaokamau, the man said: “The birds which
sit on the outside are his eyes, and it is by them that he is warned of the approach
of any person. On hearing this warning he prepared himself for the conflict. The men
with him are also his eyes; they are the ones who tell him when the enemy is near
and this gives him a chance to use his wits and to defend himself. But if the birds
and the men are first killed then Imaikalani can be slain, he will not escape.”

<p>When Omaokamau heard this from the man, he stood up and started off to carry out the
advice given him. When he came up to the place where the birds generally sat he crept
up cautiously and struck them with his club, killing them. But before Omaokamau had
the chance to kill the birds, they gave their warning note and Imaikalani heard it;
so he asked his men to look and see if a man was coming. The men then looked and saw
that it was Omaokamau. When Omaokamau came up to the guards, they thought he had come
to do battle with Imaikalani, and that he would come to the battle ground and there
make his stand, when Imaikalani would get ready to fight him; but in this they were
mistaken, for Omaokamau did not go to the battle ground but came right along fearlessly
with his war club in his hand. As soon as he came up to the two men he struck them
with his war club, killing them. He then turned to Imaikalani and poked him in the
stomach with the point of his club, killing him.

<p>Omaokamau then returned to Umi, the king, and told him of the death of Imaikalani,
slain by his hands. When Umi and the rest of the people heard this, they asked him
how he was able to kill the great and famous Imaikalani. Omaokamau then said to them:
“This is how I was able to slay Imaikalani: Yesterday on going down to the stream
of <span class="corr" title="Source: Manoni" id="xd32e13761">Mauoni</span> for a bath, I met a Maui man who asked me: ‘Have you people killed Imaikalani?’ I
said, ‘No.’ Then he said to me: ‘Yes, it is only a small thing to kill him.’ When
I heard this, I asked him to tell me how it could be done, while I promised him at
the same time that I would keep his name and identity a secret. He then told me how
I was to do it; said he, ‘Here is the way to kill Imaikalani: You must first kill
the birds and the two watchmen, who are Imaikalani’s guards and who give him warning
of the approach of any person. Kill the birds and the men, then you will be able to
kill Imaikalani.’ That is how I was able to kill him.”
