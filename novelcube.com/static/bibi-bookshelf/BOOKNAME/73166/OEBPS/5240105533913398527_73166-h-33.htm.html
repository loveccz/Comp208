<p class="first">Kekuawahine was a master hand at deceiving and falsifying; he could turn an untruth
into a reality; from correct to incorrect, and so forth. When Kamehameha was residing
at Pakaka,<a class="noteRef pginternal" href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-33.htm.html#xd32e16622" id="xd32e16622src">1</a> Kona, Oahu (that is the place where “White man Jim” lives), at the time that the
islands from Hawaii to Niihau were subjugated by him, he was living with his wife,
Kaahumanu. Kanaihalau was an uncle of Kaahumanu, whom she placed in power over Hamakua,
Kawaihae and Waimea. These lands are on Hawaii, and of course, Kanaihalau became very
much favored by his niece, Kaahumanu. On this account Kekuawahine and all the chiefs
were very envious of him, and could not get along together at Waimea and Kawaihae.
Therefore Kekuawahine meditated on a plan of action.

<p>Kanaihalau was then with his deputy, superintending the lands. There were two of them,
however, Kanaihalau and Malaihi, who were chiefs over Hamakua, Waimea and Kawaihae.
Malaihi was at Oahu, residing with Kekuawahine, and while thus living together, Kekuawahine
said to Malaihi: “Let us go until we come near to the presence of Kamehameha; you
will then stay behind, and I will go forward and have conversation with Kamehameha,
while you will watch me talk.” After this conference they set forth, and when they
were near enough, Malaihi remained behind.

Kanaihalau’s death. If I stretch out my hand, that is the signal for Kanaihalau’s
death. If I bow down and nod back toward here, then that is a sign for you to go and
kill Kanaihalau. So you remain and watch while I go and talk with Kamehameha.”
</p>
<p>Kekuawahine then proceeded to the outside of Kamehameha’s fence and stood there watching
Kamehameha chatting with the chiefs. And while they were talking Kekuawahine stretched
his arm toward the sea, and afterwards looked to the rear and nodded. After performing
these movements, he returned to Malaihi.

<p>After these instructions Malaihi went back to Hawaii, and landed at Kawaihae. He then
went up and passed Waimea, arriving at Hamakua. He found Kanaihalau residing at Eleio,
in Waikoekoe. Kanaihalau was then murdered, the bones were stripped of the flesh and
bundled up in mats, hence the expression “Kanaihalau Paahu” <span class="pageNum" id="pb488">[<a href="5240105533913398527_73166-h-33.htm.html#pb488" class="pginternal">488</a>]</span>to this day. The death of Kanaihalau was reported to Kaahumanu in Oahu, who thereupon
began to wail until she came into the presence of Kamehameha, and when Kamehameha
heard of the occurrence, he commanded that Malaihi be killed. Thus died those chiefs.

Kamehameha, at Nuuanu. Kaalamakaoikuwa was the warrior of Oahu, and resided at Luahenewai,
Waikiki-kai. Makaioulu with a companion warrior, Naaimokuokama by name, came and met
Kaalamakaoikuwa. Instantly Makaioulu was seized and held prisoner, while Naaimokuokama
ran away. And while he was running, Makaioulu called after him: “Do you run away and
leave me?” When Naaimokuokama heard this he stopped. Makaioulu then said: “Hurl that
spear that you hold in your hand straight to my navel.” Naaimokuokama did so, and
at the same time that he did, Makaioulu dodged to one side, the spear striking Kaalamakaoikuwa
and killing him. Makaioulu escaped, and they went thence to Puowaina.

<p>Here were ten soldiers, who when they saw the two, pointed their ten spears at them
at the same time. And while they were doing this, Makaioulu turned rearward and said
to his companion: “Say, if they hurl their spears to my front, you stand sideways;
and if they hurl at my side you stand at my right. Do not wink or you will be hit.”
Makaioulu then faced about and went forward. And when he came near to the ten men
they hurled spears at him. He dodged and the spears missed him. As their spears missed
him, Makaioulu made a sweep with his war club which caught six men, four escaping.

in Maui, was the birthplace of Keliimalolo. One day he and his companions left Hana,
sailing for and arriving at Kapakai, in Kohala, Hawaii. On arriving at Kapakai, Keliimalolo
left without helping to draw the canoes up. He went along the beach and arrived at
Kawaihae, Puako and Kaniku, successively.
